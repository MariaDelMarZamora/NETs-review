Region prioritization for the development of carbon capture and utilization technologies;In recent years several strategies have been developed and adopted to reduce the levels of the Greenhouse Gas Emissions released to the atmosphere. The adoption of Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) technologies may contribute towards carbon sequestration as well as to the creation of high value products. This study presents a methodology to assess the potential of CO2 utilization across Europe, and to identify the European regions with the greater potential to deploy nine selected carbon dioxide utilization technologies. The results show that Germany, UK and France at the first level followed by Spain, Italy and Poland are the countries where the larger quantities of available CO2 could be found but also where the majority of the potential receiving processes are located, and therefore with the greatest potential for CO2 utilization. The study has also revealed several specific regions where reuse schemes based on CO2 could be developed both in Central Europe (Dusseldorf and Cologne - Germany, Antwerp Province and East Flanders - Belgium and Ślaskie - Poland) and in Scandinavia (Etelä-Suomi and Helsinki-Uusimaa - Finland). Finally, among all the selected technologies, concrete curing and horticulture production are the technologies with the higher potential for CO2 utilization in Europe. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Emerging materials for lowering atmospheric carbon;CO2 emissions from anthropogenic sources and the rate at which they increase could have deep global ramifications such as irreversible climate change and increased natural disasters. Because greater than 50% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions come from small, distributed sectors such as homes, offices, and transportation sources, most renewable energy systems and on-site carbon capture technologies for reducing future CO2 emissions cannot be effectively utilized. This problem might be mediated by considering novel materials and technologies for directly capturing/removing CO2 from air. However, compared to materials for capturing CO2 at on-site emission sources, materials for capturing CO2 directly from air must be more selective to CO2, and should operate and be stable at near ambient conditions. In this review article, we briefly summarize the recent developments in materials for capturing carbon dioxide directly from air. We discuss the challenges in this field and offer a perspective for developing the current state-of-art and also highlight the potential of a few recent discoveries in materials science that show potential for advanced application of air capture technology. © 2016;2017;1;1;X
CO2 Capture from Ambient Air by Crystallization with a Guanidine Sorbent;Carbon capture and storage is an important strategy for stabilizing the increasing concentration of atmospheric CO2 and the global temperature. A possible approach toward reversing this trend and decreasing the atmospheric CO2 concentration is to remove the CO2 directly from air (direct air capture). Herein we report a simple aqueous guanidine sorbent that captures CO2 from ambient air and binds it as a crystalline carbonate salt by guanidinium hydrogen bonding. The resulting solid has very low aqueous solubility (K-sp=1.0-(4) X 10(-8)), which facilitates its separation from solution by filtration. The bound CO2 can be released by relatively mild heating of the crystals at 80-120 degrees C, which regenerates the guanidine sorbent quantitatively. Thus, this crystallization-based approach to CO2 separation from air requires minimal energy and chemical input, and offers the prospect for low-cost direct air capture technologies.;2017;1;1;
The Nature of Adsorbed Carbon Dioxide on Immobilized Amines during Carbon Dioxide Capture from Air and Simulated Flue Gas;The structure and nature of adsorbed species on solid amine sorbent under various CO2 concentrations from ambient air (0.04 vol%) to an CO2/air stream (15 vol%) have been studied by using in situ IR spectroscopy. The in situ IR study (i) provided evidence to support the zwitterion pathway for CO2 adsorption/desorption and (ii) allowed the determination of the nature of the adsorbed species. The IR-observable zwitterion was deprotonated to ammonium carbamate and carbamic acid reversibly. CO2 adsorbs on the primary amine site as a strongly adsorbed species in the form of ammonium carbamate and on the secondary amine site as a weakly adsorbed species in the form of carbamic acid. Another form of weakly adsorbed species could be ammonium carbamate on the secondary amine. An increase of the concentration of CO2 in the stream increased the CO2 capture capacity, the fraction of strongly adsorbed CO2, and the binding energy of adsorbed species. A concentration of 400 ppm CO2 in air competes over 0.5% of water vapor for adsorption on Class I amine sorbents.;2017;1;0;
Highly efficient post-combustion CO2 capture by low-temperaturesteam-aided vacuum swing adsorption using a novel polyamine-based solidsorbent;A novel amine-based solid sorbent was prepared for CO2 capture, and the CO2 adsorption characteristics were evaluated for simulated flue gas. Furthermore, CO2 capture tests using a lab-scale three-column fixed-bed system were performed. A novel amine compound was synthesized by attaching hindered functional groups to the terminal primary amino groups of a polyamine, followed by impregnation into pelletized mesoporous MSU-F silica. This novel amine-impregnated solid sorbent overcame the problem of limited CO2 diffusion and exhibited extremely high regenerability even at low temperatures. Lab-scale CO2 capture tests suggested that operation conditions such as temperature, cycle time, rinsing time, flow rate, and regeneration method directly affected CO2 capture performance. In particular, direct low-temperature steam stripping desorption drastically enhanced CO2 capture performance. Steam-aided vacuum swing adsorption (SA-VSA) process was feasible for our amine-based solid sorbent and enabled the recovery of CO2 with high purity (>98%) and recovery rate (>93%). The regeneration heat calculated from the amount of recovered CO2 and the amount of supplied steam was considerably lower (1.47 GJ/t-CO2) than that of liquid amine solvents and other amine-based solid sorbents.

Parametric analysis using AMP and MEA as aqueous solvents for CO2absorption;Chemical absorption (or reactive absorption) is a common technique used for gas sweetening purposes, capturing acid components from point source emissions or even from ambient air (Cheng and Tan, 2011). CO2 reactive absorption is extensively studied as it is a very effective process, targeting to the emissions reduction of this dangerous greenhouse gas, with wide perspective for further optimization. Reactive absorption combines physical absorption and reaction between acid components and basic solvents, thus the modelling of these mechanisms is challenging and requires a multi-component design (Koronaki et al., 2013).In this work, a rate-based, steady state model, based on the two-film theory, is presented and it is validated for two alkanolamine based aqueous solvents, Mono-ethanolamine (MEA) and 2-Amino-2-methyl1-propanol (AMP). The model predictions are validated against data extracted by experiments conducted in a pilot scale absorption column with random packing. The comparisons between the model results and the experimental data reveal satisfactory predictions of the various parameters' profiles along the column.A parametric analysis is performed, investigating the effect of inlet gas and liquid flow rates, the initial liquid loading, the type of packing, the initial amine solution concentration and the gas and liquid inlet temperatures on the CO2 absorption efficiency and on the temperature of the liquid getting out the column. The sensitivity analysis shows that the gas flow rate entering the column is the most important factor influencing the CO2 removal efficiency. In addition, inlet liquid temperature has the greater statistical significance on the outlet liquid temperature. The comparison of the two solvents under the same reference conditions shows that MEA is more efficient as solvent for CO2 absorption. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2017;1;0;
Reuse and recycling of amine-functionalized silica materials for CO2adsorption;The reuse and recycling of amine-silica materials as CO2 adsorbents were investigated for understanding their industrial viability. CO2 adsorbents were obtained by grafting of diethylenetriamine (DT) or impregnation of polyethyleneimine (PEI) onto SBA-15 silica. CO2 desorption conditions were evaluated, optimizing the time and temperature to reduce energy costs. In all cases, conditions as mild as 90 degrees C and 90 min were enough to completely remove all CO2 adsorbed. After that, a number of adsorption-desorption cycles at 110 degrees C for DT (60 min) and PEI (75 min) samples were carried out in order to study their cyclability.The recycling of CO2 adsorbents after their lifespan was studied by analysing the physicochemical properties and CO2 uptake of recycled samples obtained by calcination and subsequent refunctionalization with DT or PEI. Materials obtained after grafting the calcined samples exhibited progressively thicker silica walls and lower silanol surface concentration, yielding a smaller amine efficiency during CO2 capture. On the contrary, materials obtained after impregnating the calcined samples maintained their CO2 adsorption properties even after 6 cycles, without significant changes in their silica structure or amine efficiency for CO2 adsorption.

Atmospheric monitoring of carbon capture and storage leakage usingradiocarbon;We outline the methodology for detection of carbon dioxide (CO2) leaks to the atmosphere from carbon capture and storage (CCS) using measurements of radiocarbon in CO2. The radiocarbon method can unambiguously identify recently added fossil-derived CO2 such as CCS leaks due to the very large isotopic difference between radiocarbon-free fossil derived CO2 and natural CO2 sources with ambient radiocarbon levels. The detection threshold of 1 ppm of fossil-derived CO2 is comparable to other proposed atmospheric detection methods for CCS leakage. We demonstrate that this method will allow detection of a 1000 ton C yr(-1) leak 200-300 m from the source during the day and more than 600 m away at night. Using time-integrated sampling techniques, long time periods can be covered with few measurements, making the method feasible with existing laboratory-based radiocarbon measurement methods We examine the method using previously published observations and new model simulations for a case study in Taranaki, New Zealand. Plant material faithfully records the radiocarbon content of assimilated CO2 and we show that short-lived grass leaves and cellulose from tree rings provide effective time-integrated collection methods, allowing dense spatial sampling at low cost. A CO2 absorption sampler allows collection at controlled times, including nighttime, and gives similar results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2017;0;0;
Flue-gas and direct-air capture of CO2 by porous metal-organic materials;"Sequestration of CO2, either from gas mixtures or directly from air (direct air capture), is a technological goal important to large-scale industrial processes such as gas purification and the mitigation of carbon emissions. Previously, we investigated five porous materials, three porous metal-organic materials (MOMs), a benchmark inorganic material, Zeolite 13X and a chemisorbent, TEPA-SBA-15, for their ability to adsorb CO2 directly from air and from simulated flue-gas. In this contribution, a further 10 physisorbent materials that exhibit strong interactions with CO2 have been evaluated by temperature-programmed desorption for their potential utility in carbon capture applications: four hybrid ultramicroporous materials, SIFSIX-3-Cu, DICRO-3-Ni-i, SIFSIX-2-Cu-i and MOOFOUR-1-Ni; five microporous MOMs, DMOF-1, ZIF-8, MIL-101, UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH2; an ultramicroporous MOM, Ni-4-PyC. The performance of these MOMs was found to be negatively impacted by moisture. Overall, we demonstrate that the incorporation of strong electrostatics from inorganic moieties combined with ultramicropores offers improved CO2 capture performance from even moist gas mixtures but not enough to compete with chemisorbents.This article is part of the themed issue 'Coordination polymers and metal-organic frameworks: materials by design'.";2017;1;0;
Adsorption Microcalorimetry of CO2 in Confined Aminopolymers;Aminopolymers confined within mesoporous supports have shown promise as materials for direct capture of CO2, from ambient air. In spite of this, relatively little is known about the energetics of CO2, binding in these materials, and the limited calorimetric studies published to date have focused on materials made using molecular aminosilanes rather than amine polymers. In this work, poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) is impregnated within mesoporous SBA-15, and the heats of CO2, adsorption at 30 degrees C are investigated using a Tian-Calvet calorimeter with emphasis on the role of PEI loading and CO2, pressure in the compositional region relevant to direct capture of CO2, from ambient air. In parallel, CO2, uptakes of these materials are measured using multiple complementary approaches, including both volumetric and gravimetric methods, and distinct changes in uptake as a function of CO, preskre and amine loading are observed. The CO2, sorption behavior is directly linked to textural data describing the porosity and PEI distribution in the materials.;2017;1;0;
A Life Cycle Assessment Case Study of Coal-Fired Electricity Generationwith Humidity Swing Direct Air Capture of CO2 versus MEA-BasedPostcombustion Capture;Most carbon capture and storage (CCS) envisions capturing CO2 from flue gas. Direct air capture (DAC) of CO2 has hitherto been deemed unviable because of the higher energy associated with capture at low atmospheric concentrations. We present a Life Cycle Assessment of coal-fired electricity generation that compares monoethanolamine (MEA)-based postcombustion capture (PCC) of CO2 with distributed, humidity-swing-based direct air capture (HS-DAC). Given suitable temperature, humidity, wind, and water availability, HS-DAC can be largely passive. Comparing energy requirements of HS-DAC and MEA-PCC, we find that the parasitic load of HS-DAC is less than twice that of MEA-PCC (60-72 kJ/mol versus 33-46 kJ/mol, respectively). We also compare other environmental impacts as a function of net greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation: To achieve the same 73% mitigation as MEA-PCC, HS-DAC would increase nine other environmental impacts by on average 38%, whereas MEA-PCC would increase them by 31%. Powering distributed HS-DAC with photovoltaics (instead of coal) while including recapture of all background GHG, reduces this increase to 18%, hypothetically enabling coal-based electricity with net-zero life-cycle GHG. We conclude that, in suitable geographies, HS-DAC can complement MEA-PCC to enable CO2 capture independent of time and location of emissions and recapture background GHG from fossil-based electricity beyond flue stack emissions.;2017;1;1;
Systems Design and Economic Analysis of Direct Air Capture of CO2through Temperature Vacuum Swing Adsorption Using MIL-101(Cr)-PEI-800and mmen-Mg-2(dobpdc) MOF Adsorbents;Direct air capture (DAC) removes CO2 from the atmosphere and can therefore address sizable nonpoint sources emissions of CO2 such as those from transportation. We propose a five-step temperature vacuum swing adsorption process for direct air capture using solid adsorbents coated as films on monolithic contactors using steam as the stripping agent during desorption. We perform a modeling study and economic assessment for DAC using two metal organic frameworks, MIL-101(Cr)-PEI-800 and mmen-Mg-2(dobpdc), for which we have experimentally demonstrated film growth on monolith structures. The results indicate minimum energy requirements, and cost estimates are 0.145 MJ/mol-CO2 and $75-140/t-CO2 for MIL-101(Cr)-PEI-800, and 0.113 MJ/mol-CO2 and $60-190/t-CO2 for mmen-Mg2(dobpdc), respectively. The overall DAC cost is sensitive to adsorbent purchase cost and lifetime as well as cycle parameters such as adsorption and desorption times. We conclude that mmen-Mg2(dobpdc) has better performance compared to MIL-101(Cr)-PEI-800 in terms of energy requirements because of its higher capacity and nonlinear isotherm.;2017;1;1;
Thermodynamic models to accurately describe the PVTxy-behavior of water / carbon dioxide mixtures;Carbon dioxide/water (CO2/H2O) mixtures are of much interest in carbon capture and storage, atmospheric science, in the description of human lungs and in the processing of food and beverages. We present a comprehensive comparison of thermodynamic models for describing their PVTxy behavior, i.e. densities and phase compositions. The most accurate experimental data in the temperature range 273–478 K and at pressures below 61MPa are selected after a critical data evaluation. The most reliable phase equilibrium data are used to fit the binary interaction parameters of a wide range of thermodynamic models: cubic equations of state (EoS) with quadratic/Wong–Sandler/Huron–Vidal mixing rules, CPA, PC-SAFT and PCP-SAFT with different association schemes, and corresponding states models with various reference fluids. We test the predictive ability of the models by comparing to data outside of the region used in the parameter-fit. All of the thermodynamic models are fitted with the same experimental data and compared on the same basis, facilitating a general discussion about their strengths and weaknesses. As a benchmark for the performance of the models, we compare with the performance of two multiparameter EoS: GERG-2008 and EoS-CG. At least three fitting parameters are needed to represent the PVTxy behavior of CO2/H2O mixtures within an accuracy of 10%. By including a fourth parameter, it is possible to significantly improve the accuracy for phase compositions, where the Peng–Robinson cubic EoS with the Huron–Vidal mixing rule and volume shift gives the best results with an average accuracy of 4.5% and 2.8% for phase compositions and densities respectively. In comparison, the most accurate multiparameter EoS, EoS-CG, exhibits an average accuracy of 8.0% and 0.6% for phase compositions and densities respectively. © 2017 The Authors;2017;1;0;
Facilely synthesized meso-macroporous polymer as support of poly (ethyleneimine) for highly efficient and selective capture of CO2;Poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) impregnated adsorbents are promising alternatives to amine-based liquid absorbents for post-combustion capture of CO2. A current challenge is to identify meso- and/or macroporous supports with large pore volumes that can be facilely synthesized from a cost-effective approach as supports for PEI. In this work, hierarchically nanoporous poly(divinylbenzene) (PDVB) is synthesized through a one-step polymerization of readily available divinylbenzene (DVB) under solvothermal conditions without use of any template or catalyst. The synthesized PDVB is found to have abundant mesomacropores, as well as a large pore volume. Subsequently, a series of PEI-impregnated PDVB sorbents is prepared and their performance for the selective adsorption of CO2 is investigated. The PEI-PDVB composites are found to exhibit promising CO2 capacities and exceptionally high CO2/N-2 selectivities. The strength of CO2 adsorption is experimentally determined by direct calorimetric measurements. The PEI-PDVB composites show excellent stability under both dry and humidified sorption conditions during extended adsorption-desorption cycles. Based on the results obtained, these PEI-PDVB composites are identified as sorbents with significant potential for application in practical CO2 capture from industrial gas streams.

Two {Dy-2} single-molecule magnets formed via an in situ reaction by capturing CO2 from atmosphere under ambient conditions;Under ambient conditions, CO2 was captured from atmosphere and reduced for sequestering CO2 into two {Dy-2} single-molecule magnets through an in situ organic ligand reaction of hydrazine. A reasonable reaction mechanism is proposed, which provides a promising route towards the capturing and transforming CO2 into single-molecule magnets.;2017;1;0;
Design of Aminopolymer Structure to Enhance Performance and Stability of CO2 Sorbents: Poly(propylenimine) vs Poly(ethylenimine);Studies on aminopolymer/oxide composite materials for direct CO2 capture from air have often focused on the prototypical poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) as the aminopolymer. However, it is known that PEI will oxidatively degrade at elevated temperatures. This degradation has been ascribed to the presence of secondary amines, which, when oxidized, lose their CO2 capture capacity. Here, we demonstrate the use of small molecule poly(propylenimine) (PPI) in linear and dendritic architectures supported in silica as adsorbent materials for direct CO2 capture from air. Regardless of amine loading or aminopolymer architecture, the PPIbased sorbents are found to be more efficient for CO2 capture than PEI-based sorbents. Moreover, PPI is found to be more resistant to oxidative degradation than PEI, even while containing secondary amines, as supported by FTIR, NMR, and ESI-MS studies. These results suggest that PPI-based CO2 sorbents may allow for longer sorbent working lifetimes due to an increased tolerance to sorbent regeneration conditions and suggest that the presence of secondary amines may not mean that all aminopolymers will oxidatively degrade.;2017;1;0;
The Holy Grail: Chemistry Enabling an Economically Viable CO2 Capture, Utilization, and Storage Strategy;Technologies for reducing the concentration of CO2 in our atmosphere are essential for mitigating the risks of climate change, and novel chemistry is required for such technologies to work at scale.

Stability of a Benzyl Amine Based CO2 Capture Adsorbent in View of Regeneration Strategies;In this work, the chemical and thermal stability of a primary amine-functionalized ion-exchange resin (Lewatit VP OC 1065) is studied in view of the potential options of regenerating this sorbent in a CO2 removal application. The adsorbent was treated continuously in the presence of air, different O-2/CO2/N, mixtures, concentrated CO2, and steam, and then the remaining CO, adsorption capacity was measured. Elemental analysis, BET/BJH analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and thermogravirnetric analysis were applied to characterize adsorbent properties. This material was found to be thermally and hydrothermally stable at high temperatures. However, significant oxidative degradation occurred already at moderate temperatures (above 70 degrees C). Temperatures above 120 degrees C lead to degradation in concentrated dry CO2. Adding moisture to the concentrated CO2 stream improves the CO2-induced stability. Adsorbent regeneration with nitrogen stripping is studied with various parameters, focusing on minimizing the moles of purge gas required per mole of CO2 desorbed.;2017;1;0;
CO2 separation membranes and carbon capture and storage (CCS);An explosive increase of atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gas, particularly CO2, causes global warming and climate change. One of the effective solutions should be mitigation of CO2 emission through the air by Carbon Capture and Storage, CCS. CO2 is separated over other gaseous components at the mass emission sources, such as thermal power plants, and then stored under ground or seabed after transportation by pipeline or tanker truck. For implementation of CCS, the capture cost should be drastically reduced, which is equivalent to develop novel CO2 capture technologies with much lower energy consumption. Among various CO2 capture technologies, membrane separation is promising because difference in pressure or chemical potential between feed and permeate sides drives the separation, and basically additional energy, such as heating in liquid amine scrubbing technology, is not required at all. A number of CO2 separation membranes have been investigated, and herein, the recent progress and the potentiality of membrane separation in CO2 capture are reviewed. © 2016 The Society of Polymer Science,Japan.;2016;0;0;
Comparative carbon dioxide capture from air between chlorella vulgaris and Chlorella sorokiniana;Background/Objectives: In this research, the potential of a commercial microalgae species namely, Chlorella vulgaris and a native microalgae species isolated from a palm oil mill effluent, Chlorella sorokiniana to capture carbon dioxide from the air was investigated. Methods/Statistical Analysis: Both of the species were cultured in Bold Basal Medium (BBM) at three different concentrations denoted as 1.0 BBM, 2.0 BBM and 3.0 BBM. Among the parameters that were analyzed included pH value, optical density, specific growth rate, dry biomass and the rate of carbon dioxide gas captured by the microalgae. Findings: Different medium concentrations caused a different growth rate of C. vulgaris and C. sorokiniana. C. vulgaris favored an environment with a lower pH value ranging from pH 6.0-6.5 while the native isolated microalgae species, C. sorokiniana prefers a higher pH medium which has a range of 7.0-8.0. In addition, C. sorokiniana has a higher specific growth rate, 0.0452 h-1 in 3.0 BBM compared to C. vulgaris that only has a specific growth rate of 0.0013 h-1 in 1.0 BBM. C. vulgaris had the highest dry biomass value of 0.016 g/L in 1.0 BBM in comparison to C. sorokiniana with 2.438 g/L for the dry biomass in 3.0 BBM. It is also observed that the C. sorokiniana microalgae in 3.0 BBM has the highest potential of capturing carbon dioxide gas from air at a rate of 4.584 g/L in comparison with C. vulgaris microalgae in 2.0 BBM that only captured 0.030 g/L of carbon dioxide from air. Application/Improvements: The locally isolated microalgae have shown a vast potential as an alternative for carbon dioxide capture.;2016;1;0;X photo
Topological comparisons of fluvial reservoir rock volumes using Betti numbers: Application to Co2 storage uncertainty analysis;To prevent the release of large quantities of CO2 into the atmosphere, carbon capture and storage (CCS) represents a potential means of mitigating the contribution of fossil fuel emissions to global warming and ocean acidification. Fluvial saline aquifers are favourite targeted reservoirs for CO2 storage. These reservoirs are very heterogeneous but their heterogeneities were rarely integrated into CO2 reservoir models. Moreover, contrary to petroleum reservoirs, the available dataset is very limited and not supposed to be enriched. This leads to wide uncertainties on reservoir characteristics required for CSS management (injection location, CO2 plume migration, etc.). Stochastic simulations are classical strategies in such under-constrained context. They aim at generating a wide number of models that all fit the available dataset. The generated models serve as support for computing the required reservoir characteristics and their uncertainties. A challenge is to optimize the uncertainty computations by selecting stochastic models that should have a priori very different flow behaviours. Fluid flows depend on the connectivity of reservoir rocks (channel deposits). In this paper, it is proposed to study the variability of the Betti numbers in function of different fluvial architectures. The aim is to quantify the impact of fluvial heterogeneities and their spatial distribution on reservoir rock topology and then on CO2 storage capacities. Representative models of different scenarios of channel stacking and their internal heterogeneities are generated using geostatistical simulation approaches. The Betti numbers are computed on each generated models and statistically analysed to exhibit if fluvial architecture controls reservoir topology. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.;2016;0;0;
Dynamic capture of low-concentration CO2 on amine hybrid silsesquioxane aerogel;Amine hybrid silsesquioxane aerogel (AHSA) was synthesized through a single-step sol-gel process followed by supercritical drying. CO2 adsorption performances of highly porous AHSA in 1% CO2 were investigated. 50 degrees C is preferred to perform the CO2 capture of AHSA to achieve a CO2 adsorption capacity of 3.04 mmol/g (dry) or 3.84 mmol/g (humid) under given conditions. A rise in adsorption gas flow rate from 300 to 700 ml/min results in the decrease of CO2 adsorption capacity from 3.04 to 2.42 mmol/g. The CO2 adsorption rate is mainly affected by the gas flow rate, while the effect of temperature can be ignored. Different with the adsorption performance, the CO2 desorption kinetics of AHSA is mainly affected by the temperature, the effect of gas flow rate is indifferent. Water favors the CO2 capture capability of AHSA, however, it is bad for the CO2 adsorption and desorption kinetics. The CO2 adsorption capacities of AHSA in 1% CO2 are much higher than those of other amine based porous adsorbents obtained with a 1% or even higher CO2 gas mixture. Also, AHSA has very short adsorption half time (22-55 s) and low desorption temperature of 80 degrees C, much lower than those of other amine-based adsorbents. The resulting adsorbent is dynamic and possesses excellent regenerability for low-concentration CO2 capture. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2016;1;0;
Heat and mass transfer of temperature-vacuum swing desorption for CO2 capture from air;A transient heat and mass transfer model is developed to simulate the desorption step of a temperature vacuum swing cyclic process for CO2 capture from ambient air. The model incorporates binary CO2 and H2O adsorption equilibrium data, heat of adsorption, heat conduction, gas phase diffusion, and considers CO2 adsorption from both dry and moist air. A set of desorption experimental runs was carried out using a packed bed of amine-functionalized nanofibrillated cellulose sorbent material in the temperature range 20-95 degrees C and at 62 mbarabs desorption pressure. Numerically calculated temperature profiles were compared to those obtained experimentally. The simulation results indicate fast gas diffusion and local re-adsorption of CO2 and H2O in colder zones of the reactor. The risk of O-2-induced sorbent degradation is substantially reduced under humid air conditions as opposed to dry conditions, since air is purged out of the reactor by co-desorbed H2O before reaching a critical temperature. Further, the CO2 recovery rates at a given purity level are analyzed for the first time for a direct air capture system and it is found that, for typical process conditions, more than 90% of the captured CO2 can be recovered at >99% purity.

Preparation and kinetics of a heterogeneous sorbent for CO2 capture from the atmosphere;Capturing CO2 directly from the atmosphere using chemicals (air capture) is a strategic approach to mitigate global warming. Before the widespread deployment of air capture, technical challenges, such as the poor kinetics under ultra-low CO2 concentrations, must be addressed. This work aims to characterize and optimize the mass transfer process of a novel moisture swing adsorption method for air capture. The phase inversion technique is employed to fabricate a heterogeneous structured sorbent. The modified shrinking core model and a revolving bed reactor are developed to evaluate the adsorption kinetics. The sorbents exhibit significant diffusion-controlled kinetics under most of the measurement conditions. The effects of ambient conditions on kinetics, such as temperature and relative humidity, were investigated. The diffusion and chemical reaction rate drop sharply as the temperature decreases from 20 to 0 degrees C. The relative humidity shows a more obvious effect on the chemical reaction than on the physical diffusion process due to the mechanisms of hydration water involved in the chemical reaction. On the other hand, reducing the size of the sorbent particles to several micrometers could effectively avoid the substantial reduction in the adsorption rate under lower temperatures. Using the determined kinetic parameters, suggestions for kinetics optimization are proposed for air capture under different weather conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2016;1;0;
Climate change impacts on the sustainability of the firewood harvest and vegetation and soil carbon stocks in a tropical dry forest in Santa Teresinha Municipality, Northeast Brazil;"The Brazilian semi-arid region is characterized by low and erratic rainfall, high temperatures and high potential evapotranspiration. The removal of firewood from the native tropical dry forest, called ""Caatinga"", can negatively impact important ecosystem services, such as soil conservation, water resources, biodiversity and atmospheric carbon capture, if performed in an unsustainable manner. Most global climate models indicate that Caatinga will experience temperature increases and rainfall decreases in the next few decades. We used the Century model to simulate the impact of climate changes on woody vegetation growth and on vegetation and soil organic carbon stocks in a Caatinga area managed with a single clear cut or cuts every 10 years, 15 years, and 20 years, followed or not followed by the burning of plant residues (leaves and small branches) left after firewood removal. The effects of future climate projections, (LOW, MIDI and HIGH members of the climate scenario SRES A1B, which corresponded to different CO2 emission predictions, downscaled by the Eta/CPTEC model), were compared to those of the projection of the historical climate. With the current climate, it would take 50 years to regenerate the Caatinga biomass stock to a level close to that before cutting after a single cut, followed or not followed by fire. Therefore, the recommended cutting cycles (10-20 years) were not long enough to allow for the regeneration of a fully mature Caatinga. However, all of these cycles reached sustainable biomass production levels, with similar total productions until the end of the century. Under these conditions, the lower proportions of biomass recovery of shorter cycles would be compensated by more frequent cutting. The model also indicated that burning or not burning the residues would have little effect. On the contrary, if the climate changes as predicted, the biomass of the native Caatinga vegetation and soil organic carbon stock would decrease throughout this century, even without cutting the vegetation. All of the cutting cycles would not provide sustainable firewood production, with reduced production after each consecutive cut. Therefore, if the climate changes as expected, forest management legislation should require longer periods of forest recovery between cutting cycles for sites with environmental conditions (e.g., climate, soil and vegetation) similar to those of the present study.

Climate Impact and Economic Feasibility of Solar Thermochemical Jet Fuel Production;Solar thermochemistry presents a promising option for the efficient conversion of H2O and CO2 into liquid hydrocarbon fuels using concentrated solar energy. To explore the potential of this fuel production pathway, the climate impact and economic performance are analyzed. Key drivers for the economic and ecological performance are thermo-chemical energy conversion efficiency, the level of solar irradiation, operation and maintenance, and the initial investment in the fuel production plant. For the baseline case of a solar tower concentrator with CO2 capture from air, jet fuel production costs of 2.23 (sic)/L and life cycle greenhouse gas (LC GHG) emissions of 0.49 kg(CO2-equiv)/L are estimated. Capturing CO2 from a natural gas combined cycle power plant instead of the air reduces the production costs by 15% but leads to LC GHG emissions higher than that of conventional jet fuel. Favorable assumptions for all involved process steps (30% thermochemical energy conversion efficiency, 3000 kWh/(m(2) a) solar irradiation, low CO2 and heliostat costs) result in jet fuel production costs of 1.28 (sic)/L at LC GHG emissions close to zero. Even lower production costs may be achieved if the commercial value of oxygen as a byproduct is considered.;2016;1;1;X for fuel production
Conversion of CO2 from Air into Methanol Using a Polyamine and aHomogeneous Ruthenium Catalyst;A highly efficient homogeneous catalyst system for the production of CH3OH from CO2 using pentaethylenehexamine and Ru-Macho-BH (1) at 125-165 degrees C in an ethereal solvent has been developed (initial turnover frequency = 70 h(-1) at 145 degrees C). Ease of separation of CH3OH is demonstrated by simple distillation from the reaction mixture. The robustness of the catalytic system was shown by recycling the catalyst over five runs without significant loss of activity (turnover number > 2000). Various sources of CO2 can be used for this reaction including air, despite its low CO2 concentration (400 ppm). For the first time, we have demonstrated that CO2 captured from air can be directly converted to CH3OH in 79% yield using a homogeneous catalytic system.;2016;1;0;X for fuel production
Characterization of kinetic limitations to atmospheric CO2 capture by solid sorbent;Scrubbing CO2 directly from the ambient air (air capture) by sorbent is an emerging technology to address climate change due to anthropic emission of greenhouse gases. A good understanding of thermodynamics and reaction kinetics under ultra-low CO2 concentration and variable humidity is fundamental to the design of economic air capture. In this study, the adsorption kinetics of a novel moisture swing process for air capture is characterized. The variation of humidity alters not only the adsorption equilibrium but also the adsorption kinetics, due to a water involved chemical reaction. A heterogeneously structured sorbent sheet with strong based ion exchange resin inside as active constituent is employed to capture the atmospheric CO2 under different humidity. Traditional shrinking core model (SCM) is modified to reveal the mass transfer resistance inside of the sorbent for CO2 adsorption under ultra-low CO2 concentration. The modified SCM reveals that, at most cases, the adsorption kinetics is controlled by diffusion inside of the sorbent particle. A transition from physical diffusion controlled kinetics to chemical reaction controlled kinetics is observed as humidity increases. Further kinetic analysis suggests that, among the optimization technologies such as seeking functional group with faster chemical reaction or fabricating thinner support layer, preparing sorbent particle with smaller size or higher porosity should have much more potential on the enhancement of air capture kinetics.

An overview of activated carbons utilization for the post-combustion carbon dioxide capture;The increase of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the ambient air has become the key factor in the pace of temperature rise, and accordingly, is a primary contributor towards global warming scenario. In view of this, the quick mitigation efforts associated with capturing CO2 from fossil fuel combustion source must be implemented to alleviate environmental catastrophic events in future. Therefore, the purpose of this paper was to review the role and performances of activated carbon in capturing anthropogenic CO2 flue gas prior to emission to air. Throughout this paper, the activated carbons which were proposed to be a separation medium for CO2 capture are evaluated in terms of equilibrium adsorption capacity as well as the surface modification. The utilization of the activated carbons instead of current state-of-art technology, which is the chemical absorption is promising as it avoids higher energy penalty encountered in regeneration process and the consumption of corrosive chemical such as aqueous amine-based solvent. In addition, the investigation on the potential of activated carbons for post-combustion CO2 capture is expected to confer scientists with critical information related to the future direction of the activated carbons in an industrial application, and as an alternative to conventional amine scrubbing process.

Steam Regeneration of Polyethylenimine-Impregnated Silica Sorbent for Postcombustion CO2 Capture: A Multicyclic Study;"Steam regeneration of polyethylenimine (PEI)-impregnated commercial grade silica was investigated in a packed bed reactor. Adsorption was performed at 75 degrees C under 10% CO2/N-2, and desorption was carried out under steam at 110 degrees C for 20 consecutive cycles. CO, adsorption capacity was found to decrease by 9 mol % over the period of 20 cycles. No evident signs of sorbent degradation due to PEI leaching or changes in surface morphology and amine functionalities were observed upon characterization of the sorbent after the cyclic study. Most of the loss in adsorption capacity was associated with thermal degradation of the sorbent during drying under N-2 after steam stripping at 110 degrees C. The desorption kinetics during steam stripping was found to be much faster than during N2 stripping. Over 80% of the total CO, was released within the first 3 min of steam injection into the reactor. A separate packed bed study was conducted to investigate the influence of moisture content (5.3-14.7 vol %) in flue gas on the CO, adsorption capacity of PEI-impregnated silica. The presence of moisture had a positive impact on CO2 uptake of the sorbent; a 4-9 mol % increase in CO2 uptake was observed in comparison to the adsorption under dry conditions. However, the presence of moisture increased the heat of regeneration of the sorbent significantly. It was calculated that the energy demand increased approximately 2-fold on introduction of 14.7% moisture compared to that of dry flue gas.";2016;0;0;
Flexible, amine-modified silica aerogel with enhanced carbon dioxide capture performance;One kind of flexible, amine-modified silica aerogel (AMSA) was prepared using sol-gel method and ambient drying technology. The obtained AMSA displays excellent mechanical strength. It can endure up to ca. 80 % linear compression and spring back to more than 95 % of its original size reversible deformation during uniaxial compression tests. The formed AMSA has abundant micropore, mesopore and macropore. Its porosity is higher than 90 %. The amine groups are incorporated into the silica network via covalent bond. The porous structure and the content of amine groups can be easily changed by adjusting the synthesis condition. High mechanical property, abundant pores, high content and stable amine groups give the obtained AMSA excellent CO2 adsorption properties. Its CO2 adsorption capacity can reach 6.45 mmol/g in simulated ambient air under 1 bar of dry CO2, as well as good stability over 50 adsorption-desorption cycles.;2016;1;0;
Amidine-Functionalized Poly(2-vinyl-4,4-dimethylazlactone) for Selective and Efficient CO2 Fixing;Development of novel polymeric materials capable of efficient CO2 capture and separation under ambient conditions is crucial for cost-effective and practical industrial applications. Here we report the facile synthesis of a new CO2-responsive polymer through postpolymerization modification of poly(2-vinyl-4,4-dimethylazlactone) (PVDMA). The reactive pendant azlactone groups of PVDMA are easily modified with 4-(N-methyltetrahydropyrimidine)benzyl alcohol (PBA) without any byproduct formation. FUR and TGA experiments show the new PBA-functionalized polymer powder can reversibly capture CO2 at room temperature and under atmospheric pressure. CO2 capture was selective, showing a high fixing efficiency even with a mixed gas system (20% CO2, 80% N-2) similar to flue gas. CO2 release occurred at room temperature, and release profiles were investigated as a function of temperature. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations coupled with modeling and. simulation reveal the presence of two CO2 binding sites in the PBA-functionalized polymer resulting in a two-step CO2 release at room temperature. The ease of material preparation, high fixing efficiency, and robust release characteristics suggest that postpolymerization modification may be a useful route to designing new materials for CO2 capture.;2016;1;0;
Design guidance for an energy-thrift absorption process for carbon capture: Analysis of thermal energy consumption for a conventional process configuration;"The development of an energy-thrift carbon capture process to reduce atmosphere CO2 emissions is an urgent need; however, comprehensive and systematic design guidelines for energy-minimized gas separation processes are not easily available. This study aims to understand the fundamentals of thermal energy usage in an absorption system and provide quantitative and integrated guidelines to design a minimum-energy-demanding, absorption-based carbon capture process using aqueous solvents. Solvent capacity and absorption performance are the most important factors, whereas the heat of reaction, considered important in many studies, is actually not a critical factor to determine the thermal energy usage. The shape of the vapor-liquid equilibrium curve also has a significant effect on the regeneration energy. When designing a minimum thermal energy process, the cyclic capacity, absorption performance, and heat of reaction should be considered simultaneously rather than separately because they affect the total thermal energy demand interactively. The minimum achievable regeneration energy in an absorption-based process with a typical process configuration for coal-fired plant flue gas was estimated as 2.3-2.5 GJ/t-CO2 with an optimized heat of reaction of approximately 60-70 kl/mol-CO2. Brief analysis of the equivalent work up to the compression stage was also made, and the relationship with the thermal energy is discussed. The fundamentals learned through this study can be extended to other absorption-based gas separation processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.";2016;1;0;
Effect of algal species and light intensity on the performance of an air-lift-type microbial carbon capture cell with an algae-assisted cathode;The performances were investigated for air-lift-type microbial carbon capture cells (ALMCCs) with Chlorella vulgaris and Chlorella sp. as cathodic microorganisms. The two ALMCC systems showed differences in CO2 fixation, lipid production and power generation. The ALMCC system with Chlorella vulgaris produced a maximum power density of 558.22 mW m(-3), a CO2 fixation rate of 223.68 mg L-1 d(-1) and lipid productivity of 21.75 mg L-1 d(-1), indicating that Chlorella vulgaris performed better than Chlorella sp. By conducting further experiments with Chlorella vulgaris under different light intensities (2.4, 5.0, 8.9 and 11.4 W m(-2)), the ALMCC was found to be sensitive to light intensities. The maximum power outputs and CO2 fixation rate were observed under light intensity of 8.9 W m(-2) (972.5 mW m-3 and 887.8 mg L-1 d(-1), respectively). The lipid productivity was increased with the light intensity from 2.4 to 11.4 W m(-2). However, there was no difference in lipid productivities between light intensities of 8.9 and 11.4 W m(-2) (p > 0.05). These results suggested that 8.9 W m(-2) was the optimal light intensity for CO2 fixation, lipid production and power generation of the ALMCC with Chlorella vulgaris.;2016;1;0;photo
Capture CO2 from Ambient Air Using Nanoconfined Ion Hydration;Water confined in nanoscopic pores is essential in determining the energetics of many physical and chemical systems. Herein, we report a recently discovered unconventional, reversible chemical reaction driven by water quantities in nanopores. The reduction of the number of water molecules present in the pore space promotes the hydrolysis of CO32- to HCO3- and OH-. This phenomenon led to a nano-structured CO2 sorbent that binds CO2 spontaneously in ambient air when the surrounding is dry, while releasing it when exposed to moisture. The underlying mechanism is elucidated theoretically by computational modeling and verified by experiments. The free energy of CO32- hydrolysis in nanopores reduces with a decrease of water availability. This promotes the formation of OH-, which has a high affinity to CO2. The effect is not limited to carbonate/bicarbonate, but is extendable to a series of ions. Humidity-driven sorption opens a new approach to gas separation technology.;2016;1;0;
Toward the Development and Deployment of Large-Scale Carbon Dioxide Capture and Conversion Processes;In light of the depletion of fossil fuels and the increased daily requirements for liquid fuels and chemicals, CO2 should indeed be regarded as a valuable C-1. additional feedstock for sustainable manufacturing of liquid fuels and chemicals. Development and deployment of CO2 capture and chemical conversion processes are among the grand challenges faced by today's scientists and engineers. Very few of the reported CO2 capture and conversion technologies have been employed for industrial installations on a large scale, where high-efficiency, cost/energy-effectiveness, and environmental friendliness are three keys factors. The CO2 capture technologies from stationary sources and ambient air based on solvents, solid sorbents, and membranes are discussed first. Transforming CO2 to liquid fuels and chemicals, which are presently produced from petroleum, through thermochemical, electrochemical, photochemical, and biochemical routes are discussed next. The relevant state-of-the-art computational methods and tools as a complement to experiments are also briefly discussed. Finally, after pointing out the advantages and disadvantages of the currently available technologies for CO2 capture and conversion, ideas and perspectives for the development of new techniques, opportunities, and challenges are highlighted.;2016;1;0;X
Cost analysis of air capture driven by wind energy under different scenarios;Reducing the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air can effectively alleviate climate change. Air capture, which captures CO2 directly from the air in an industrial process, is an alternative option to address climate change. The results of recent studies on the energy demand in CO2 capture process and the costs of CO2 transport and CO2 storage in air capture are analyzed in this paper. Considering renewable energy will not produce additional CO2 in the process of utilization, the electric energy in CO2 capture process of air capture driven by wind energy is different from that of carbon capture and storage. Taking externalities of renewable energy into account, the trading price of CO2 emission is taken to assess the cost of electric energy in CO2 capture of air capture driven by wind energy. Finally, the total cost and the total cost savings of air capture driven by wind energy under different scenarios are analyzed.;2016;1;1;X
Carbon dioxide emission from bamboo culms;Bamboos are one of the fastest growing plants on Earth, and are widely considered to have high ability to capture and sequester atmospheric carbon, and consequently to mitigate climate change. We tested this hypothesis by measuring carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from bamboo culms and comparing them with their biomass sequestration potential. We analysed diurnal effluxes from Bambusa vulgaris culm surface and gas mixtures inside hollow sections of various bamboos using gas chromatography. Corresponding variations in gas pressure inside the bamboo section and culm surface temperature were measured. SEM micrographs of rhizome and bud portions of bamboo culms were also recorded. We found very high CO2 effluxes from culm surface, nodes and buds of bamboos. Positive gas pressure and very high concentrations of CO2 were observed inside hollow sections of bamboos. The CO2 effluxes observed from bamboos were very high compared to their carbon sequestration potential. Our measurements suggest that bamboos are net emitters of CO2 during their lifespan.;2016;0;0;
New developments on carbon dioxide capture using amine-impregnated silicas;A series of representative amines were impregnated on SBA-15 mesostructured silica. Ethylenediamine, 1,6-diaminohexane, hexamethyleneimine, tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA), branched polyethyleneimine (PEI), piperazine (PZ), and 4-amino-2-hydroxy-6-methylpyrimidine (PD) were used as impregnating agents. Impregnated materials were characterized by N-2 adsorption-desorption, elemental analysis and CO2 adsorption-desorption. CO2 analyses were performed at 45 degrees C with the aim of reproducing industrial post-combustion conditions. Relevant differences in CO2 uptake were assigned to the kind of amino group used and their position in the molecule (i.e., primary, secondary or tertiary, isolated, close to aromatic rings...). PEI, TEPA and PZ were also impregnated over SBA-AP, i.e., SBA-15 grafted with aminopropyl-trimethoxysilane (AP), by using a double functionalization method. CO2 uptake and amine efficiency (CO2/N molar ratio) were found to depend on the nature of the impregnating molecule. Improved stability and CO2 capture properties were obtained for samples impregnated over SBA-AP, achieving a CO2 adsorption capacity of 104 mg CO2/g ads (2.4 mmol CO2/g ads) for SBA-AP-TEPA (45 degrees C, 1 bar), with an amine efficiency of 0.32 mol CO2/mol N (SBA-AP-TEPA, 45 degrees C, 1 bar).;2016;1;0;
Impact of solvents and surfactants on the self-assembly of nanostructured amine functionalized silica spheres for CO2 capture;Macroscopic SiO2 spheres with a homogeneous amine distribution were synthesized by a one-step emulsion based synthesis approach in a flow column reactor. The CO2 adsorption capacity of the nano structured amine-functionalized silica spheres was studied in absence and presence of H2O. The structural properties were adjusted by varying solvents and surfactants during the synthesis and, at constant amine loadings, were found to be the main factor for influencing the CO2 sorption capacities. Under water-free conditions CO2 is bound to the amino groups via the formation of carbamates, which require two neighboring amino groups to adsorb one CO2 molecule. At constant amine concentrations sorbents with lower surface area allow to establish a higher amine density on the surface, which enhances the CO2 uptake capacities under dry conditions. In presence of H2O the CO2 adsorption changes to 1:1 stoichiometry due to stabilization of carbamates by protonation of H2O and formation of further species such as bicarbonates, which should in principle double the adsorption capacities. Low concentrations of physisorbed H2O (0.3 mmol/g) did not impair the adsorption capacity of the adsorbents for CO2, while at higher water uptakes (0.6 and 1.1 mmol/g) the CO2 uptake is reduced, which could be attributed to capillary condensation of H2O or formation of bulky reaction products blocking inner pores and access to active sites.

Theoretical studies on CO2 capture behavior of quaternary ammonium-based polymeric ionic liquids;"Quaternary ammonium-based polymeric ionic liquids (PILs) are novel CO2 sorbents as they have high capacity, high stability and high binding energy. Moreover, the binding energy of ionic pairs to CO2 is tunable by changing the hydration state so that the sorbent can be regenerated through humidity adjustment. In this study, theoretical calculations were conducted to reveal the mechanism of the humidity swing CO2 adsorption, based on model compounds of quaternary ammonium cation and carbonate anions. The electrostatic potential map demonstrates the anion, rather than the cation, is chemically preferential for CO2 adsorption. Further, the proton transfer process from water to carbonate at the sorbent interface is successfully depicted with an intermediate which has a higher energy state. By determining the CO2 adsorption energy and activation energy at different hydration states, it is discovered that water could promote CO2 adsorption by reducing the energy barrier of proton transfer. The adsorption/desorption equilibrium would shift to desorption by adding water, which constitutes the theoretical basis for humidity swing. By analyzing the hydrogen bonding and structure of the water molecules, it is interesting to find that the CO2 adsorption weakens the hydrophilicity of the sorbent and results in release of water. The requirement of latent heat for the phase change of water could significantly reduce the heat of adsorption. The special ""self-cooling'' effect during gas adsorption can lower the temperature of the sorbent and benefit the adsorption isotherms.";2016;1;0;
Spectroscopic Investigation of the Mechanisms Responsible for the Superior Stability of Hybrid Class 1/Class 2 CO2 Sorbents: A New Class 4 Category;Hybrid Class 1/Class 2 supported amine CO2 sorbents demonstrate superior performance under practical steam conditions, yet their amine immobilization and stabilization mechanisms are unclear. Uncovering the interactions responsible for the sorbents' robust features is critical for further improvements and can facilitate practical applications. We employ solid state Si-29 CP-MAS and 2-D FSLG H-1-C-13 CP HETCOR NMR spectroscopies to probe the overall molecular interactions of aminosilane/silica, polyamine [poly(ethylenimine), PEI]/silica, and hybrid aminosilane/PEI/silica sorbents. A unique, sequential impregnation sorbent preparation method is executed in a diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) setup to decouple amine binding mechanisms at the amine silica interfacefrom those within bulk amine layers. These mechanisms are correlated with each sorbents' resistance to accelerated liquid H2O and TGA steam treatments (H2O stability) and to oxidative degradation (thermal stability). High percentages of CO2 capture retained (PCR) and organic content retained (OCR) values after H2O testing of N-(3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl)ethylenediamine (TMPED)/PEI and (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (APTMS)/PEI hybrid sorbents are associated with a synergistic stabilizing effect of the amine species observed during oxidative degradation (thermal gravimetric analysis-differential scanning calorimetry, TGA-DSC). Solid state NMR spectroscopy reveals that the synergistic effect of the TMPED/PEI mixture is manifested by the formation of hydrogen-bonded PEI NH2 center dot center dot center dot NH2 TMPED and PEI NH2 HO Si/O Si-O (TMPED, T-2) linkages within the sorbent. DRIFTS further determines that PEI enhances the grafting of TMPED to silica and that PEI is dispersed among a stable network of polymerized TMPED in the bulk, utilizing H-bonded linkages. These findings provide the scientific basis for establishing a Class 4 category for aminosilane/polyamine/silica hybrid sorbents.;2016;1;0;
Ambient CO2 capture and storage in bioelectrochemically mediated wastewater treatment;This study reports that wastewater can be used to capture and store CO2 directly from ambient air and produce energy. The proof-of-concept system consisted of an ion exchange resin column that captures and concentrates ambient CO2 using a moisture-driven cycle. The concentrated CO2 was then transferred into a microbial electrochemical carbon capture (MECC) reactor for carbon sequestration and hydrogen production. Data from an average batch cycle showed that approximately 8 mmol/L CO2 was captured in the MECC cathode when 0.14 g/L COD was removed in the anode. With 90% hydrogen conversion efficiency, the energy intensity and CO2 absorption from the process could be 11.3 kJ/gCOD and 0.49 gCO(2)/gCOD respectively. If the proposed process is applied, over 68 million tons of atmospheric CO2 can be captured yearly during wastewater treatment in the US, which equates to significant economic values if CO2 taxes were to be implemented more widely.

Pore chemistry and size control in hybrid porous materials for acetylenecapture from ethylene;The trade-off between physical adsorption capacity and selectivity of porous materials is a major barrier for efficient gas separation and purification through physisorption. We report control over pore chemistry and size in metal coordination networks with hexafluorosilicate and organic linkers for the purpose of preferential binding and orderly assembly of acetylene molecules through cooperative host-guest and/or guest-guest interactions. The specific binding sites for acetylene are validated by modeling and neutron powder diffraction studies. The energies associated with these binding interactions afford high adsorption capacity (2.1 millimoles per gram at 0.025 bar) and selectivity (39.7 to 44.8) for acetylene at ambient conditions. Their efficiency for the separation of acetylene/ethylene mixtures is demonstrated by experimental breakthrough curves (0.73 millimoles per gram from a 1/99 mixture).;2016;0;0;
A Fine-Tuned Fluorinated MOF Addresses the Needs for Trace CO2 Removal and Air Capture Using Physisorption;The development of functional solid-state materials for carbon capture at low carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, namely, from confined spaces (<0.5%) and in particular from air (400 ppm), is of prime importance with respect to energy and environment sustainability. Herein, we report the deliberate construction of a hydrolytically stable fluorinated metal organic framework (MOF), NbOFFIVE-1-Ni, with the appropriate pore system (size, shape, and functionality), ideal for the effective and energy-efficient removal of trace carbon dioxide. Markedly, the CO2-selective NbOFFIVE-1-Ni exhibits the highest CO2 gravimetric and volumetric uptake (ca. 1.3 mmol/g and 51.4 cm(3) (STP) cm(-3)) for a physical adsorbent at 400 ppm of CO2 and 298 K. Practically, NbOFFIVE-1-Ni offers the complete CO2 desorption at 328 K under vacuum with an associated moderate energy input of 54 kJ/mol, typical for the full CO2 desorption in conventional physical adsorbents but considerably lower than chemical sorbents. Noticeably, the contracted square-like channels, affording the close proximity of the fluorine centers, permitted the enhancement of the CO2 framework interactions and subsequently the attainment of an unprecedented CO2 selectivity at very low CO2 concentrations. The precise localization of the adsorbed CO2 at the vicinity of the periodically aligned fluorine centers, promoting the selective adsorption of CO2, is evidenced by the single-crystal X-ray diffraction study on NbOFFIVE-1-Ni hosting CO2 molecules. Cyclic CO2/N-2 mixed-gas column breakthrough experiments under dry and humid conditions corroborate the excellent CO2 selectivity under practical carbon capture conditions. Pertinently, the notable hydrolytic stability positions NbOFFIVE-1-Ni as the new benchmark adsorbent for direct air capture and CO2 removal from confined spaces.;2016;1;0;
Early atmospheric detection of carbon dioxide from carbon capture and storage sites;The early atmospheric detection of carbon dioxide (CO2) leaks from carbon capture and storage (CCS) sites is important both to inform remediation efforts and to build and maintain public support for CCS in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. A gas analysis system was developed to assess the origin of plumes of air enriched in CO2, as to whether CO2 is from a CCS site or from the oxidation of carbon compounds. The system measured CO2 and O-2 concentrations for different plume samples relative to background air and calculated the gas differential concentration ratio (GDCR = -O-2/CO2). The experimental results were in good agreement with theoretical calculations that placed GDCR values for a CO2 leak at 0.21, compared with GDCR values of 1-1.8 for the combustion of carbon compounds. Although some combustion plume samples deviated in GDCR from theoretical, the very low GDCR values associated with plumes from CO2 leaks provided confidence that this technology holds promise in providing a tool for the early detection of CO2 leaks from CCS sites. Implications: This work contributes to the development of a cost-effective technology for the early detection of leaks from sites where CO2 has been injected into the subsurface to enhance oil recovery or to permanently store the gas as a strategy for mitigating climate change. Such technology will be important in building public confidence regarding the safety and security of carbon capture and storage sites.;2016;0;0;
Poly(ethylenimine)-Functionalized Monolithic Alumina Honeycomb Adsorbents for CO2 Capture from Air;The development of practical and effective gas-solid contactors is an important area in the development of CO2 capture technologies. Target CO2 capture applications, such as post-combustion carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) from power plant flue gases or CO2 extraction directly from ambient air (DAC), require high flow rates of gas to be processed at low cost. Extruded monolithic honeycomb structures, such as those employed in the catalytic converters of automobiles, have excellent potential as structured contactors for CO2 adsorption applications because of the low pressure drop imposed on fluid moving through the straight channels of such structures. Here, we report the impregnation of poly(ethylenimine) (PEI), an effective aminopolymer reported commonly for CO2 separation, into extruded monolithic alumina to form structured CO2 sorbents. These structured sorbents are first prepared on a small scale, characterized thoroughly, and compared with powder sorbents with a similar composition. Despite consistent differences observed in the filling of mesopores with PEI between the monolithic and powder sorbents, their performance in CO2 adsorption is similar across a range of PEI contents. A larger monolithic cylinder (1 inch diameter, 4 inch length) is evaluated under conditions closer to those that might be used in large-scale applications and shows a similar performance to the smaller monoliths and powders tested initially. This larger structure is evaluated over five cycles of CO2 adsorption and steam desorption and demonstrates a volumetric capacity of 350 mol(CO2) m(monolith)(-3) and an equilibration time of 350 min under a 0.4 ms(-1) linear flow velocity through the monolith channels using 400 ppm CO2 in N-2 as the adsorption gas at 30 degrees C. This volumetric capacity surpasses that of a similar technology considered previously, which suggested that CO2 could be removed from air at an operating cost as low as $100 per ton.;2016;1;1;X
An Initial Laboratory Prototype Experiment for Sequestration of Atmospheric CO2;An initial phase of laboratory investigation has been completed in pursuit of a global-scale methodology for reduction of CO2 in ambient air through direct air capture (DAC). The methodology presented previously by Agee, Orton, and Rogers provides the background for this study. The laboratory prototype experiment presented has been designed to assess the potential for removing CO2 from ambient air by snow deposition. The approach consists of refrigeration to achieve the required CO2 deposition temperature of 135 K at 1 bar of pressure. The refrigerant of choice is liquid nitrogen (LN2) with cooling (77 K) at the top of a cylindrical 26.5-L Pyrex glass sequestration chamber. A highly conductive aluminum base with 14 instrumentation ports rests at the interface between the LN2 reservoir and the sequestration chamber. The cooling and mixing through Rayleigh-Taylor instability achieves uniform deposition temperature. Insulation to maintain the cooling process is provided to sustain CO2 depletion phase change at 135 K. The coldest temperature achieved in experimentation was 125 K. The required cooling period was 4.5 h, with an additional hour to achieve uniform chamber temperatures <= 135 K through top-down convective mixing. Experimental measurements showed a reduction of CO2 in the chamber air from initial values of similar to 500 ppmv down to 35 ppmv. Discussion is given to the issue of chamber CO2 frost versus CO2 snowflake formation, as well as the overall relevance of the experiment to DAC through refrigeration and storage in Antarctica to reduce atmospheric CO2.;2016;1;1;
Direct Evidence of CO2 Capture under Low Partial Pressure on a Pillared Metal-Organic Framework with Improved Stabilization through Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonding;"Direct structural observation of CO2-loaded MOFs is helpful for revealing the specific binding interactions to allow the design of better CO2 sorbents, but such direct structural evidence is almost always observed for pure-component CO2 under a pressure of 1 atm or more, which does not really represent practical CO2 capture and separation under low partial pressure (<= 1 atm) in the presence of other gases. Herein, a series of isoreticular MOFs [Zn(Trz)(R-BDC)(1/2)] (FJU-40-R, R=H, NH2, Br, or OH) are synthesized. Among them, FJU-40-NH2 exhibits the highest robustness, and good heat and water resistance, attributed to its intramolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions. A CO2/N-2 (15: 85, v/v) mixture can be separated efficiently through a column packed bed of FJU-40-NH2 solid. The structures of CO2-loaded FJU-40-NH2 at 1 atm under various atmosphere conditions, including pure CO2, CO2/N-2 (15: 85, v/v), and air, are observed, and it is found that: 1) the mechanism for CO2 loading into the cages depends on the CO2 partial pressure; 2) FJU40-NH2 can capture CO2 directly from air, and CO2 will have priority to occupy hydrophobic cage-I, whereas hydrophilic cage-II containing the amino group is occupied by H2O molecules; 3) the triazolate C-H groups, rather than the amino groups in past observations in dry ice, act as predominant functional sites here under low CO2 partial pressure.";2016;1;0;
On Thermodynamic Separation Efficiency: Adsorption Processes;"A simplified thermodynamic analysis of adsorption processes in temperature swing adsorption (TSA) and pressure swing adsorption (PSA) modes as a function of adsorbate concentration and the adsorbent-adsorbate interaction strength is presented in this article. The thermodynamic separation efficiency of a TSA process is optimal at dilute feed conditions, and becomes more thermodynamically efficient with increasing adsorbate affinity even though the energy of separation increases. The adsorption process is spontaneous, and for a strong isotherm, the energy required to reverse the adsorption is nearly independent of the adsorbate concentration as adsorbate loading in nearly-saturated materials is essentially constant with feed concentration. PSA units are efficient thermodynamically and the efficiency increases with the concentration of the desired adsorbate. This thermodynamic treatment has implications for separation processes that address carbon emissions. TSA systems operate more efficiently (thermodynamically) in the ""air capture"" case because they apply work to the concentrated product rather than the dilute feed.

Herein, we report the selective Xe uptake in a crystalline porous organic oligomeric molecule, noria, and its structural analogue, PgC-noria, under ambient conditions.

Putting an ultrahigh concentration of amine groups into a metal-organic framework for CO2 capture at low pressures;Tremendous efforts have been devoted to increasing the CO2 capture performance of porous materials, especially for low CO2 concentration environments. Here, we report that hydrazine can be used as a diamine short enough to functionalize the small-pore metal-organic framework [Mg-2(dobdc)] (H(4)dobdc = 2,5-dihydroxyl-1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid). By virtue of the ultra-high concentration of free amine groups (6.01 mmol g(-1) or 7.08 mmol cm(-3)) capable of reversible carbamic acid formation, the new material [Mg-2(dobdc)(N2H4)(1.8)] achieves a series of new records for CO2 capture, such as single-component isotherm uptakes of 3.89 mmol g(-1) or 4.58 mmol cm(-3) at the atmospheric CO2 concentration of 0.4 mbar at 298 K and 1.04 mmol g(-1) or 1.22 mmol cm(-3) at 328 K, as well as more than a 4.2 mmol g(-1) or 4.9 mmol cm(-3) adsorption/desorption working capacity under dynamic mixed-gas conditions with CO2 concentrations similar to those in flue gases and ambient air.;2016;1;0;
Capture of CO2 in air for 4,5-disubstituted furan-2(5H)-ones;A highly efficient strategy for carbon dioxide capture and utilization (CCU) was applied to the synthesis of 4,5-disubstituted furan-2(5H)-ones by a Cu(I)/base catalytic system. An aqueous morpholine solution as a superior adsorbent for the capture of carbon dioxide directly from air was recycled continuously via adsorption/desorption cycles.;2016;1;0;
Epoxide-functionalization of polyethyleneimine for synthesis of stable carbon dioxide adsorbent in temperature swing adsorption;Amine-containing adsorbents have been extensively investigated for post-combustion carbon dioxide capture due to their ability to chemisorb low-concentration carbon dioxide from a wet flue gas. However, earlier studies have focused primarily on the carbon dioxide uptake of adsorbents, and have not demonstrated effective adsorbent regeneration and long-term stability under such conditions. Here, we report the versatile and scalable synthesis of a functionalized-polyethyleneimine (PEI)/silica adsorbent which simultaneously exhibits a large working capacity (2.2 mmol g(-1)) and long-term stability in a practical temperature swing adsorption process (regeneration under 100% carbon dioxide at 120 degrees C), enabling the separation of concentrated carbon dioxide. We demonstrate that the functionalization of PEI with 1,2-epoxybutane reduces the heat of adsorption and facilitates carbon dioxide desorption (499%) during regeneration compared with unmodified PEI (76%). Moreover, the functionalization significantly improves long-term adsorbent stability over repeated temperature swing adsorption cycles due to the suppression of urea formation and oxidative amine degradation.;2016;1;0;
Direct Air Capture of CO2 Using Amine Functionalized MIL-101(Cr);Direct adsorption of CO2 from ambient air, also known as direct air capture (DAC), is gaining attention as a complementary approach to processes that capture CO2 from more concentrated sources such as flue gas. Oxide-supported amine materials are effective materials for CO2 capture from dilute gases, but less work has been done on metal organic framework (MOF) supported amine materials. Use of MOFs as supports for amines could be a versatile approach to the creation of effective amine adsorbents because of the tunability of MOF structures. In the present work, MIL-101(Cr) materials functionalized with amine species are evaluated for CO2 capture from simulated air. Two amines are loaded into the MOF pores, tris (2-amino ethyl) (TREN) and low molecular weight, branched poly(ethylene imine) (PEI 800), at different amine loadings. The MIL-101(Cr)-TREN composites showed high CO2 capacities for high loadings of TREN, but a significant loss of amines is observed over multicycle temperature swing adsorption experiments. In contrast, MIL-101(Cr)-PEI-800 shows better cyclic stability. The amine efficiency (mol CO2/mol amine) as a function of amine loading is used as a metric to characterize the adsorbents. The amine efficiency in MIL-101(Cr)-PEI-800 showed a strong dependence on the amine loading, with a step change to high amine efficiencies occurring at similar to 0.8 mmol PEI/g MOF. The kinetics of CO2 capture, which have important implications for the working capacity of the adsorbent, are also examined, demonstrating that a MIL-101(Cr)-PEI-800 sample with a 1-1.1 mmol PEI/g MOF loading has an excellent balance of CO2 capacity and CO2 adsorption kinetics.;2016;1;0;
Direct Capture of CO2 from Ambient Air;"The increase in the global atmospheric CO2 concentration resulting from over a century of combustion of fossil fuels has been associated with significant global climate change. With the global population increase driving continued increases in fossil fuel use,, humanity's primary reliance on fossil energy for the next several decades is assured. Traditional modes of carbon capture such as precombustion and postcombustion CO2 capture from large point sources can help slow the rate of increase of the atmospheric CO2 concentration, but only the direct removal of CO2 from the air, or ""direct air capture"" (DAC), can actually reduce the global atmospheric CO2 concentration. The past decade has seen a steep rise in the use of chemical sorbents that are cycled through sorption and desorption cycles for CO, removal from ultradilute gases such as air. This Review provides a historical overview of the field of DAC, along with an exhaustive description of the use of chemical sorbents targeted at this application. Solvents and solid sorbents that interact strongly with CO2 are described, including basic solvents, supported amine and ammonium materials, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), as the primary classes of chemical sorbents. Hypothetical processes for the deployment of such sorbents are discussed, as well as the limited array of technoeconomic analyses published on DAC. Overall, it is concluded that there are many new materials that could play a role in emerging DAC technologies. However, these materials need to be further investigated and developed with a practical sorbent-air contacting process in mind if society is to make rapid progress in deploying DAC as a means of mitigating climate change.";2016;1;1;X
Cutting the cost of carbon capture: a case for carbon capture and utilization;A significant part of the cost for carbon capture and storage ( CCS) is related to the compression of captured CO2 to its supercritical state, at 150 bar and typically 99% purity. These stringent conditions may however not always be necessary for specific cases of carbon capture and utilization ( CCU). In this manuscript, we investigate how much the parasitic energy of an adsorbent-based carbon capture process may be lowered by utilizing CO2 at 1 bar and adapting the final purity requirement for CO2 from 99% to 70% or 50%. We compare different CO2 sources: the flue gases of coal-fired or natural gas-fired power plants and ambient air. We evaluate the carbon capture performance of over 60 nanoporous materials and determine the influence of the initial and final CO2 purity on the parasitic energy of the carbon capture process. Moreover, we demonstrate the underlying principles of the parasitic energy minimization in more detail using the commercially available NaX zeolite. Finally, the calculated utilization cost of CO2 is compared with the reported prices for CO2 and published costs for CCS.;2016;1;1;X
Photocatalytic CO2 conversion over Au/TiO2 nanostructures for dynamic production of clean fuels in a monolith photoreactor;Global economic development intensifies the consumption of fossil fuels which results in increase of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the atmosphere. The technologies for carbon capture and utilization to produce cleaner fuels are of great significance. However, phototechnology provides one perspective for economical CO2 conversion to cleaner fuels. In this study, CO2 conversion with H-2 to selective fuels over Au/TiO2 nanostructures using environment friendly continuous monolith photoreactor has been investigated. Crystalline nanoparticles of anatase TiO2 were obtained in the Au-doped TiO2 samples. The Au deposited over TiO2 in metal state produced plasmonic resonance. CO2 was efficiently converted to CO as the main product over Au/TiO2 with a maximum yield rate of 4144 A mu mol g-catal.(-1) h(-1), 345 fold-higher than using un-doped TiO2 catalyst. The significantly enhanced photoactivity of Au/TiO2 catalyst was due to hindered charges recombination rate and Au metallic-interband transition. The photon energy in the UV range was high enough to excite the d-band electronic transition in the Au to produce CO, CH4, and C2H6. The quantum efficiency over Au/TiO2 catalyst for CO was considerably improved in the continuous monolith photoreactor. At higher space velocity, the yield rates of CO gradually reduced, but the initial rates of hydrocarbon yields increased. The stability of the recycled Au/TiO2 catalyst was sustained in cyclic runs. Thus, Au-doped TiO2 supported over monolith channels is promising for enhanced CO2 photoreduction to high energy products. This provides pathway that phototechnology to be explored further for cleaner and economical fuels production.;2016;1;1;
Amine hybrid aerogel for high-efficiency CO2 capture: Effect of amine loading and CO2 concentration;The objective of this research was to develop a high-performance CO2 adsorbent by a simple, cost-effective and environmental-friendly route based on amine hybrid aerogel. A new amine hybrid titania/silsesquioxane composite aerogel (AHTSA) was prepared by a one-pot sol-gel process followed by supercritical drying (SCD). The wet gel was obtained by orderly mixing all the reactants in a container without adding any catalyst. SCD was conducted without contaminant emission. Effects of amine loading and CO2 concentration on pores structure and CO2 adsorption performance of AHTSA were investigated. Higher amine loading leads to lower specific surface area and mesopore volume of AHTSA, due to the increase of large pores and diminishment of mesopores when increasing the amine loading. Resulting from the sharp decrease of the surface area, overdosing of the amine precursor negatively affects the surface amine content of AHTSA and thus reduces its CO2 adsorption capacity. High CO2 concentration favors the CO2 adsorption capacity and rate as concentrated CO2 favors the CO2 diffusion in the pore space of the adsorbent, enhances the interaction between CO2 and surface amine groups. The dry CO2 adsorption capacity of AHTSA increases from 1.64, 4.19 to 6.66 mmol/g when the CO2 concentration of the mixture gas varies from 400 ppm (air), 1% to 10%. Short adsorption halftime and high amine efficiency of AHTSA with different CO2 concentrations reveal that AHTSA is a dynamic and effective adsorbent for CO2 capture, even direct air capture.

CO2 capture by amines in aqueous media and its subsequent conversion to formate with reusable ruthenium and iron catalysts;Conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) captured from industrial sources (e.g. flue gas of power plants) or even from ambient air to value-added chemicals/fuels through CO2 capture and utilization (CCU) as a possible strategy to mitigate anthropogenic CO2 emissions to the atmosphere is proposed. In this context, combining the CO2 capture and utilization steps to generate fuels instead of going through the intermediate desorption and compression of captured CO2 has started to attract considerable interest as a way to lower the energy demand for the CO2 recovery processes involved in usual carbon capture and storage/sequestration approach. The main focus of this study is CO2 capture in aqueous amine solutions and conversion of the in situ formed ammonium carbamate/bicarbonate/carbonate to ammonium formate. The amines selected for this process served the dual purpose of capturing CO2 and stabilizing the formate product. The captured CO2 was selectively converted to formate (up to 95% yield) using, among others, superbases, in the presence of Ru- and Fe-based pincer complexes under moderate reaction conditions (50 bar H-2 at 55 degrees C). By performing a biphasic reaction (water/Me-THF), the catalyst was recycled for five consecutive cycles and a TON > 7000 was obtained for the formation of ammonium formate from captured CO2. Overall, a green and straightforward approach to produce formate from captured CO2 is presented here.;2016;1;0;
Enhanced Adsorption Efficiency through Materials Design for Direct Air Capture over Supported Polyethylenimine;Until recently, carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) was regarded as the most promising technology to address the alarming increase in the concentration of anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere. There is now an increasing interest in carbon capture and utilization (CCU). In this context, the capture of CO2 from air is an ideal solution to supply pure CO2 wherever it is needed. Here, we describe innovative materials for direct air capture (DAC) with unprecedented efficiency. Polyethylenimine (PEI) was supported on PME, which is an extra-large-pore silica (pore-expanded MCM-41) with its internal surfaces fully covered by a uniform layer of readily accessible C-16 chains from cetyltrimethylammonium (CTMA(+)) cations. The CTMA(+) layer plays a key role in enhancing the amine efficiency toward dry or humid ultradilute CO2 (400 ppm CO2/N-2) to unprecedented levels. At the same PEI content, the amine efficiency of PEI/PME was two to four times higher than that of the corresponding calcined mesoporous silica loaded with PEI or with different combinations of C-16 chains and PEI. Under humid conditions, the amine efficiency of 40 wt% PEI/PME reached 7.31 mmol(CO2)/g(PEI), the highest ever reported for any supported PEI in the presence of 400 ppm CO2. Thus, amine accessibility, which reflects both the state of PEI dispersion and the adsorption efficiency, is intimately associated with the molecular design of the adsorbent.;2016;1;0;
Incorporation of Alkylamine into Metal-Organic Frameworks through a Bronsted Acid-Base Reaction for CO2 Capture;The escalating atmospheric CO2 concentration is one of the most urgent environmental concerns of our age. To effectively capture CO2, various materials have been studied. Among them, alkylamine-modified metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are considered to be promising candidates. In most cases, alkylamine molecules are integrated into MOFs through the coordination bonds formed between open metal sites (OMSs) and amine groups. Thus, the alkylamine density, as well as the corresponding CO2 uptake in MOFs, are severely restricted by the density of OMSs. To overcome this limit, other approaches to incorporating alkylamine into MOFs are highly desired. We have developed a new method based on Bronsted acid-base reaction to tether alkylamines into Cr-MIL-101-SO3H for CO2 capture. A systematic optimization of the amine tethering process was also conducted to maximize the CO2 uptake of the modified MOF. Under the optimal amine tethering condition, the obtained tris(2-aminoethyl) amine-functionalized Cr-MIL101- SO3H (Cr-MIL-101-SO3H-TAEA) has a cyclic CO2 uptake of 2.28 mmol g(-1) at 150 mbar and 40 degrees C, and 1.12 mmol g(-1) at 0.4 mbar and 20 degrees C. The low-cost starting materials and simple synthetic procedure for the preparation of Cr-MIL-101-SO3H-TAEA suggest that it has the potential for large-scale production and practical applications.;2016;1;1;
Effect of Amine Structure on CO2 Adsorption of ModifiedPoly(ethyleneimine)-Impregnated Mesostructured Silica Sorbents;Poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) was modified to study the effect of amine type and introduced hydroxy groups on its ability to capture carbon dioxide. Amines were impregnated in as-synthesized mesostructured silica (MSU-F) to fabricate solid amines, and the resulting samples were characterized via C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy. Nitrogen contents, structural properties, adsorption capacity, and sorbent durability during CO2 adsorption/desorption processes were measured to study the CO2 sorption performances of the sorbents.Reaction between PEI and propylene oxide (PO) altered the ratio of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines and also produced hydroxy groups on amine molecules. With a specific reactant ratio, a modified amine-impregnated sorbent (M-EP10) showed a CO2 adsorption capacity and amine efficiency of 13.90 wt% and 0.37, respectively, which were higher than that of the pristine PEI-impregnated sorbent. The new adsorbents also showed excellent stability in cyclic adsorption-desorption operations, even under pure CO2 desorption conditions in which commercial PEI adsorbents are known to lose CO2 adsorption capacity owing to urea formation.;2016;1;0;
CO2 capture via adsorption in amine-functionalized sorbents;Amine functionalized solid adsorbents are promising materials for the capture of CO2 because of their tunability and lower heat capacity compared to liquid amine solutions. This review focuses on recent advances in the use of solid-supported amines for CO2 capture, with emphasis on amine functionalized metal organic framework (MOF) materials. The recently reported diamine functionalized Mg-DOBPDC MOF demonstrates intriguing performance for CO2 capture, offering a unique adsorption mechanism with favorable energetics. Stable performance for CO2 capture under humid conditions and easy regenerability of the adsorbent are critical to the realization of practical CO2 adsorbents. Scalable regeneration methods such as temperature swing in a CO2 purge stream and temperature swing via steam stripping are discussed. Emerging gas-solid contacting strategies for CO2 capture with amine adsorbents are also discussed.;2016;1;0;
gamma-Alumina Nanorod/Reduced Graphene Oxide as Support for Poly(ethylenimine) to Capture Carbon Dioxide from Flue Gas;The synthesis of a mesoporous gamma-Al2O3 nanorod/reduced graphene oxide (gamma-Al2O3NR/RGO) composite with a higher surface area and thermal conductivity than unmodified gamma-Al2O3 has been accomplished, and these materials were characterized in detail. The composite was used successfully as a support for poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) to capture CO2 at high temperature. The PEI-modified composite (gamma-Al2O3NR/ RGO/PEI) showed an excellent CO2 adsorption from simulated flue gas at 75 degrees C and complete desorption at 100 degrees C with recyclability. The maximum CO2 adsorption capacity of this material was 200.6 mgg(PEI)(-1) (1.14 mmol CO(2)g(adsorbent)(-1)) with an amine efficiency of 0.22, which is higher than that of bare gamma-Al2O3/PEI. As a result of its high thermal conductivity, the overheating of the adsorbent during exothermic CO2 adsorption by PEI was restricted and as a result the thermal degradation of PEI was prevented. Accordingly, the adsorption capacity of gamma-Al2O3NR/RGO/PEI does not deteriorate like that of bare gamma-Al2O3/PEI during repeated CO2 adsorption- desorption cycles.;2016;1;0;
Effects of carbon dioxide captured from ambient air on the infrared spectra of supported amines;Amino groups in highly dense coatings of amines on solid supports react with CO2 of ambient air and form ammonium-carbamate ion pairs. These ion pairs change the properties of the amine-modified supports. In numerous studies, the corresponding infrared (IR) spectra have been misinterpreted. The presumption has been that such ion pairs would not form in ambient air, and therefore IR bands have been assigned to moieties of the support and the amines. Here, we discuss common misunderstandings of the IR spectra of amine-modified supports and highlight that proper sample handling is necessary before employing different characterization techniques. We exemplify by performing an IR spectroscopic study of a propylamine-modified porous silica. Such amine-modified supports are relevant to applications in gas separation, catalysis, controlled drug delivery and adsorption of pollutants from water. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Optimal carbon capture and storage contracts using historical CO<inf>2</inf> emissions levels;In an effort to reduce carbon dioxide (CO$$_2$$2) emissions to the atmosphere, carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has been developed to collect CO$$_2$$2 from emissions generators and store it underground. Recent proposed legislation would limit the volume of emissions generated from power sources, effectively requiring some sources to participate in CCS. Both emissions sources and storage operators require incentives to enter into contracts to capture excess emissions at the source, and transport and store the CO$$_2$$2 underground. As the level of emissions from power plants is stochastic and carryover into future time periods is expensive, we develop a newsvendor model to determine the optimal price and volume of these contracts to maximize the expected profit of the storage operator and encourage the participation of multiple emissions sources. Because the storage operator has a limit on the amount of CO$$_2$$2 that can be injected each month, this limit affects the allocation of the optimal contract amounts between the emitters. The distribution of emissions and relative costs of transportation also influence the optimal policy. In addition to analytical solutions, we present data-driven methods for using correlated emissions data to determine the optimal price and volume of these contracts. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (outside the USA).;2015;0;0;
Simultaneous online measurement of H<inf>2</inf>O and CO<inf>2</inf> in the humid CO<inf>2</inf> adsorption/desorption process;A dew point meter (DP) and an infrared (IR) CO<inf>2</inf> analyzer were assembled in a humid CO<inf>2</inf> adsorption/desorption system in series for simultaneous online measurements of H<inf>2</inf>O and CO<inf>2</inf>, respectively. The humidifier, by using surface-flushing on a saturated brine solution was self-made for the generation of humid air flow. It was found that by this method it became relatively easy to obtain a low H<inf>2</inf>O content in air flow and that its fluctuation could be reduced compared to the bubbling method. Water calibration for the DP-IR detector is necessary to be conducted for minimizing the measurement error of H<inf>2</inf>O. It demonstrated that the relative error (RA) for simultaneous online measurements H<inf>2</inf>O and CO<inf>2</inf> in the desorption process is lower than 0.1%. The high RA in the adsorption of H<inf>2</inf>O is attributed to H<inf>2</inf>O adsorption on the transfer pipe and amplification of the measurement error. The high accuracy of simultaneous online measurements of H<inf>2</inf>O and CO<inf>2</inf> is promising for investigating their co-adsorption/desorption behaviors, especially for direct CO<inf>2</inf> capture from ambient air. 2015 © The Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry.;2015;1;0;
Sustainable Food and Fuel on Yongxing Island by Conversing the Carbon Captured from Ambient Air;Synthetic hydrocarbon fuel, derived from renewable energy and captured carbon dioxide from ambient air, can thoroughly close its carbon cycle and is a promising option for CCU and an important approach to sustainable energy. We investigate the Yongxing island in south China sea, which offers steady wind resources to provide continuous energy supply for plant factory and fuel synthesis. The energy consumption of MSAC and TSAC is compared and conversion of the captured CO2to food and fuel are calculated. Powered by wind energy, 200 ton vegetables and 5.2∗103ton diesel will be produced per year, so self-sufficiency of vegetable and fuel demand can be achieved on Yongxing island.

Solar-powered process turns CO2 into valuable nanofibres;Chemists at George Washington University have found a way to capture CO2 from the air and turn it directly into useful carbon nanofibers. The process is relatively low-energy. Air is added to an electrolytic bath of molten carbonates at around 750°C. The CO2 dissolves when subjected to the heat and the current generated by nickel and steel electrodes. The carbon nanofibers build up on the steel electrode and are easily removed. Heat and electricity for the process is generated using a concentrating solar power system. The sun's rays are focused on a photovoltaic cell to generate energy and a concentrating system to generate heat for the cell. Nanofibers will form with less than 1 v of electricity at the temperatures found in the cell. The energy costs of the process would be around $1,000/ton of nanofibers, which is hundreds of times less than the value of the finished product. The process could also have a real impact on atmospheric carbon levels.;2015;1;1;
Oxy type power plant with ion transport membrane - Techno-economical analysis with investment risk evaluation;"The power plant that contains: a hard coal-fired oxy-type pulverized fuel boiler, a steam turbine unit, a carbon dioxide capture unit and an air separation unit with a four-end type ion transport membrane was analyzed in this paper. The supercritical parameters were assumed for this power plant (live steam at 650 °C/30 MPa; reheated steam at 670 °C/6 MPa). Gross electric power of the generator driven by steam turbine is equal to 600 MW. The main results of thermodynamic, economic and risk analysis for the oxy type power plant with and without the use of waste heat are presented. First method of the use of this heat is the total or partial replacement of high and low pressure regenerative water heaters. The steam bleeds from steam turbine are eliminated and the power of the generator driven by this turbine increases. Second method of use of waste heat is implementation of an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC). For all analyzed cases the isolines diagrams of the net efficiency of electricity generation and break-even price of electricity as a function of oxygen recovery rate and air compressor pressure ratio were presented in this paper. Optimal values of this quantities were compared with analogous quantities calculated for the reference power plant. The reference power plant contains: a classical pulverized fuel boiler (air as oxidant) and a steam turbine unit. Finally, the results of risk analysis for the oxy type and the reference power plant were presented as a diagram of a cumulative distribution as a function of break-even price of electricity.";2015;0;0;
Selection of the economically optimal operating parameters of the htm air separation unit integrated with a hard coal-fired supercritical power plant;Two variants of an oxy type power plant (W1 and W2) that contains steam turbine, hard coal-fired oxy-type pulverized fuel boiler, carbon dioxide capture unit and an air separation unit with a four-end type hightemperature membrane were analyzed in this paper. For both variants the live steam thermodynamic parameters are 650 °C/30 MPa and the reheated steam parameters are 670 °C/6 MPa. Gross electric power of the W1 variant of the oxy type power plant is equal to 600 MW. The second variant (W1) differs from the first one in that heat exchangers, supplied by heat from the flue gas and the gas remaining after the separation of oxygen in the air separation unit, were added. These heat exchangers were raising the temperature of the feed water in the steam turbine unit and thereby partially or completely were replacing the regenerative water heaters. The economic analysis of both variants of the oxy type power plant and the reference power plant (which contains the same steam turbine as in variant W1 of the oxy type power plant and a classical pulverized fuel boiler) were carried out in this paper. The investment costs of individual elements of the power plant were determined. These investment costs and thermodynamic indicators such as the net efficiency of electricity generation were used as inputs for economic analysis. The break-even price of electricity was used as an economic indicator. The optimal air compressor pressure ratio and optimal oxygen recovery rate were determined. Additionally the break-even price of electricity in optimal working points for both variants of oxy type power plant were compared with the breakeven price of electricity for the reference power plant.;2015;0;0;
A New Class of Single-Component Absorbents for Reversible Carbon Dioxide Capture under Mild Conditions;Some inexpensive and commercially available secondary amines reversibly react with CO2 at room temperature and ambient pressure to yield carbonated species in the liquid phase in the absence of any additional solvent. These solvent-free absorbents have a high CO2 capture capacity (0.63-0.65 mol CO2/mol amine) at 1.0 bar (= 100 kPa), combined with low-temperature reversibility at ambient pressure. C-13 NMR spectroscopy analysis identified the carbonated species as the carbamate salts and unexpected carbamic acids. These absorbents were used for CO2 (15 and 40% in air) capture in continuous cycles of absorption-desorption carried out in packed columns, yielding an absorption efficiency of up to 98.5% at absorption temperatures of 40-45 degrees C and desorption temperatures of 70-85 degrees C at ambient pressure. The absence of any parasitic solvent that requires to be heated and stability towards moisture and heating could result in some of these solvent-free absorbents being a viable alternative to aqueous amines for CO2 chemical capture.;2015;1;0;
Adsorption of CO2 at atmospheric pressure on activated carbons prepared from melamine-modified phenol-formaldehyde resins;Highly porous activated carbons were prepared from melamine-modified phenol-formaldehyde resins via steam activation at different activation temperatures (700-950 degrees C) and then used for CO2 capture at atmospheric pressure. The porosity and surface properties of the activated carbons and their CO2 adsorption capabilities were studied and compared with those derived from common phenol-formaldehyde resin. An adsorption capacity for CO2 of 6.71 mol kg(-1) (29.5 wt.%) was attained at 0 degrees C and 1 atm and decreased significantly with increasing operating temperature. The prepared activated carbons could be well applied in temperature-swing adsorption processes. Of the three isotherm equations (Langmuir, Freundlich, and Redlich-Peterson), the adsorption of CO2 on activated carbons could only be satisfactorily described using the three-parameter Redlich-Peterson equation.

Unusual Ultra-Hydrophilic, Porous Carbon Cuboids for Atmospheric-WaterCapture;There is significant interest in high-performance materials that can directly and efficiently capture water vapor, particularly from air. Herein, we report a class of novel porous carbon cuboids with unusual ultra-hydrophilic properties, over which the synergistic effects between surface heterogeneity and micropore architecture is maximized, leading to the best atmospheric water-capture performance among porous carbons to date, with a water capacity of up to 9.82mmolg(-1) at P/P-0=0.2 and 25 degrees C (20% relative humidity or 6000ppm). Benefiting from properties, such as defined morphology, narrow pore size distribution, and high heterogeneity, this series of functional carbons may serve as model materials for fundamental research on carbon chemistry and the advance of new types of materials for water-vapor capture as well as other applications requiring combined highly hydrophilic surface chemistry, developed hierarchical porosity, and excellent stability.;2015;0;0;
Work of separation in CO2 capture: Applicability of the value function;The energy requirements for two CO2 separation processes (VSA and membrane), calculated from detailed numerical simulations, are shown to be qualitatively consistent with the trends predicted from value function theory. At low feed concentrations the work of separation increases strongly, in contrast to the thermodynamic minimum work which shows only a very gradual increase. This has important implications in relation to processes such as direct air capture of CO2 in which a concentrated product is separated from a very dilute feed. The present results suggest that the energy requirements for such processes may be much greater than that has been generally assumed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2015;1;1;
Activated carbons prepared from peanut shell and sunflower seed shell for high CO2 adsorption;Biomass wastes are considered as cost-effective and sustainable precursors to prepare activated carbons for CO2 capture. In this study, two biomass-derived activated carbons were prepared using peanut shell and sunflower seed shell, and the optimal activated carbons were obtained at low KOH/carbon ratio of about 1. The peanut shell derived activated carbon (P-973-1.00) and sunflower seed shell derived activated carbon (S-973-1.25) exhibited CO2 uptake of 1.54 and 1.46 mmol/g, respectively, at 298 K and 0.15 bar, among the activated carbons with the highest CO2 adsorption. Although P-973-1.00 had much lower surface area and micropore volume than S-973-1.25, it possessed higher CO2 uptake at 298 K and 0.15 bar due to the higher volume of micropores in the range of 0.3-0.44 nm. The calculated higher isosteric heat values at lower CO2 uptake indicated the strong affinity of CO2 in these micropores. The ordered micro-sized pores in the activated carbons were favorable for CO2 diffusion into the porous materials and adsorption in the inner micropores. The activated carbons had moderate CO2 selectivity over N-2 at 1 bar, but the selectivity was significantly enhanced at 0.15 bar. The spent activated carbons after vacuum regeneration exhibited stable CO2 adsorption in five cycles, showing the high reusability for CO2 capture.;2015;1;0;
Reframing the policy approach to greenhouse gas removal technologies;"Greenhouse gas removal (GGR) methods such as direct air capture, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, biochar and enhanced weathering have recently attracted attention as ""geoengineering"" options to reverse the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Contrary to this framing, however, we argue that GGR technologies can in fact form a valuable complement to emissions control within on-going mitigation efforts. Through decoupling abatement from emissions sources, they add much-needed flexibility to the mitigation toolbox, increasing feasibility and reducing costs of meeting climate targets. Integrating GGR effectively into policy raises significant challenges relating to uncertain costs, side effects, life-cycle effectiveness and accounting. Delaying policy action until these uncertainties are resolved, however, risks missing early opportunities, suffocating innovation and locking out the long-term potential of GGR. Based on an analysis of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, we develop four policy principles to begin unlocking the potential of GGR: (i) support further research, development and demonstration; (ii) support near-term opportunities through modifying existing policy mechanisms; (iii) commit to full GGR integration in carbon accreditation and broader climate policy frameworks in future; (iv) develop sector-specific steps that lay the groundwork for future opportunities and avoid lock-out (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.";2015;1;1;
Application of Polyethylenimine-Impregnated Solid Adsorbents for Direct Capture of Low-Concentration CO2;A systematic study of CO2 capture on the amine-impregnated solid adsorbents is carried out at CO2 concentrations in the range of 400-5000 ppm, relating to the direct CO2 capture from atmospheric air. The commercially available polymethacrylate-based HP2MGL and polyethylenimine are screened to be the suitable support and amine, respectively, for preparation of the adsorbent. The adsorbents exhibit an excellent saturation adsorption capacity of 1.96 mmol/g for 400 ppm CO2 and 2.13 mmol/g for 5000 ppm CO2. Moisture plays a promoting effect on CO2 adsorption but depends on the relative humidity. The presence of O-2 would lead to the decrease of adsorption capacity but do not affect the cyclic performance. The diffusion additive is efficient to improve the adsorption capacity and cyclic performance. Moreover, the adsorbents can be easily regenerated under a mild temperature. This study may have a positive impact on the design of high-performance adsorbents for CO2 capture from ambient air.

Fast and Reversible Direct CO2 Capture from Air onto All-Polymer Nanofibrillated Cellulose-Polyethylenimine Foams;Fully polymeric and biobased CO2 sorbents composed of oxidized nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) and a high molar mass polyethylenimine (PEI) have been prepared via a freeze-drying process. This resulted in NFC/PEI foams displaying a sheet structure with porosity above 97% and specific surface area in the range 2.7-8.3 m(2).g(-1). Systematic studies on the impact of both PEI content and relative humidity on the CO2 capture capacity of the amine functionalized sorbents have been conducted under atmospheric conditions (moist air with similar to 400 ppm of CO2). At 80% RH and an optimum PEI content of 44 wt %, a CO2 capacity of 2.22 mmol.g(-1), a stability over five cycles, and an exceptionally low adsorption half time of 10.6 min were achieved. In the 20-80% RH range studied, the increase in relative humidity increased CO2 capacity of NFC/PEI foams at the expense of a high H2O uptake in the range 3.8-28 mmol.g(-1).;2015;1;0;
Fast, reversible CO2 capture in nanostructured Brownmillerite CaFeO2.5;"We observed rapid CO2 capture in nanostructured Brownmillerite CaFeO2.5 with no decay in capture capacity even after multiple cycles of carbonation and calcination. Industrial exhaust CO2 gas causes global warming as a greenhouse gas and there is an ever increasing need to develop materials for direct capture of CO2. In this work, we demonstrated CO2 capture effect in an oxygen-deficient perovskite CaFeO2.5 with Brownmillerite structure by first, exposing the compounds (bulk- and nano-CaFeO2.5) to ambient air for different durations and later, by studying fast carbonation-calcination cycles using thermogravimetry. We found that, while the physical properties of bulk-CaFeO2.5 remain unaltered; nano-CaFeO2.5 shows spontaneous capture of CO2 upon exposure to ambient air. Moreover, nano-CaFeO2.5 can be recovered completely by heating in air, showing that the capture of CO2 is reversible. Investigation of bulk and nano-CaFeO2.5 in a 2-min cycle of carbonation and calcination (regeneration) at 500 degrees C revealed that the nano-CaFeO2.5 exhibited rapid CO2 capture ability within few seconds. In addition, almost no decay in CO2 capture capacity was observed even after 30 cycles of carbonation-calcination of nano-CaFeO2.5, which is quite remarkable. Such nanostructured systems can be potential candidates for practical applications of capturing CO2 from hot exhaust gases. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.";2015;1;0;
Thermodynamics, economics and systems thinking: What role for air capture of CO2?;"Air capture has recently been advanced by several parties as a solution to the problem of constraining-and ultimately reducing-atmospheric CO2 in response to climate change. However, there are significant barriers pertaining to scale, energy needs and cost, which will hugely challenge the effectiveness and practicality of air capture. This paper examines the thermodynamics, energetics and economics and politics of air capture. These compare unfavourably with alternative approaches to atmospheric greenhouse gas reduction. An analysis is made of the energy cost of the one favoured DAC technology for which experimental results are available in the open literature - temperature/vacuum swing adsorption, and of one point source capture technology - oxyfiring of refinery FCCUs. We also examine the engineering effort required to implement atmospheric capture on a scale at which it could significantly reduce atmospheric levels of CO2; and questions are addressed regarding its practicability and appropriateness. The analysis demonstrates that air capture remains at best a peripheral activity, at worst a distraction, until point sources of greenhouse gas emissions such as power stations, industrial flue gases, shale gas wellheads, anaerobic digestion plants and landfill sites have been completely decarbonised. When these and so many other unaddressed factors are affecting our global climate, the pursuit air capture, the ultimate ""end-of-pipe"" solution, is inappropriate.

Covalent grafting of polyethyleneimine on hydroxylated three-dimensional graphene for superior CO2 capture;Covalently tethered CO2 adsorbents are synthesized by acid catalyzed ring-opening polymerization of aziridine on the basal planes of three-dimensional hydroxylated graphene (HG). The resulting materials possess high surface areas, strong covalent bonds between polyethyleneimine (PEI) and graphene, and high thermal conductivity. The HG-PEI nanocomposites exhibit high amine loading (more than 10.03 mmol N g(-1)), high adsorption capacity (up to 4.13 mmol CO2 g(-1) in simulated ambient air under 1 atm of dry CO2) as well as good stability both at low (100 degrees C) and high desorption temperatures (135 degrees C), which allows the overall CO2 capture process to be promising and sustainable.;2015;1;0;
Facile synthesis of an amine hybrid aerogel with high adsorption efficiency and regenerability for air capture via a solvothermal-assisted sol-gel process and supercritical drying;An amine hybrid resorcinol-formaldehyde/silica composite aerogel (AH-RFSA) was developed for the first time through a solvothermal-assisted sol-gel process combined with supercritical drying (SCD). The CO2 adsorption performances of AH-RFSA in air were investigated. The results reveal that the solvothermal temperature negatively affects the CO2 adsorption capacity of AH-RFSA. Water favors the CO2 adsorption capacities, especially the useful CO2 adsorption capacity. The total CO2 adsorption capacity achieved with the new adsorbent at 25 degrees C in dry and humid air is 1.80 and 2.57 mmol g(-1), respectively. The useful CO2 adsorption capacity of AH-RFSA in humid air is as high as 1.85 mmol g(-1). The adsorbent preparation method is inspiring and the resulting adsorbent is exceptional in capacity and regenerability.;2015;1;0;
Applicability of linear polyethylenimine supported on nano-silica forthe adsorption of CO2 from various sources including dry air;Adsorbents based on linear polyethylenimines (LPEIs) supported on fumed silica were prepared and studied for the reversible adsorption of CO2 under mild conditions from various gas mixtures, including dry air with a CO2 concentration of only 400 ppm. While the adsorption kinetics were similar between linear and branched PEI impregnated on fumed silica, the desorption rate was noticeably faster on linear PEI, which is advantageous for fast adsorption/desorption cycling. The enthalpy of CO2 adsorption was also lower on LPEI based adsorbents (-43 to -53 kJ mol(-1) CO2). Desorption of the adsorbed CO2 occurred rapidly at relatively low temperatures (50 to 100 degrees C). The adsorption/desorption process can be repeated for more than one hundred cycles with no noticeable decrease in adsorption capacity even under humid conditions. The stability of the adsorbents under CO2, air, and N-2 was also investigated.;2015;1;0;
Modeling and optimal operation of carbon capture from the air driven by intermittent and volatile wind power;CO2 capture from ambient air can compensate for all CO2 emissions to the atmosphere, ultimately reducing CO2 concentrations on a global scale. It has been widely explored. However, additional CO2 emits when CO2-intensive fossil fuels are used to drive the systems of CO2 capture from air. A replacement of conventional energy by wind energy to power existing systems of CO2 capture from air is proposed in this paper and its technical feasibility is validated. The intermittency and volatility of wind power supply in seasonal variations are considered when wind power is used to meet the energy requirements for CO2 capture. Energy requirements for each device in the system of CO2 capture from air are specified and the characteristics of all devices are also analyzed. In order to investigate how flexible CO2 capture regarding the variations in wind power supply, an optimal operation model is established. Each device in the system of CO2 capture is considered as a separate load, thus devices are dispatched separately rather than as a whole to improve the acceptance of fluctuant wind power. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using intermittent and volatile wind power to capture CO2 from air. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2015;1;1;
Atmospheric CO2 capture by a triphenyltin-1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane system with formation of a rare trinuclear carbonato-centered core;Direct atmospheric CO2 capture occurred during the reactions of triphenyltin chloride (Ph3SnCl) with 1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethane (bpa) in methanol and aqueous ammonia. Depending on the reaction temperature, 4 degrees C and room temperature, two different compounds were obtained: a discrete, trinuclear complex, [(Ph3SnCl)(2)(mu(3)-CO3) (Ph3Sn)(Hbpa)]center dot H2O (1), and a coordination polymer (1)(infinity)[(Ph3SnCl)(Ph3Sn)(2)(mu(3)-CO3)(bpa)]center dot H2O (2), respectively. X-Ray crystal structure analysis reveals that both compounds contain a rare trinuclear carbonato-centered core C(OSnPh3)(3). The supramolecular architecture of compound 1, assembled by hydrogen-bond interactions, is described. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2015;1;0;
Carbon dioxide removal using carbon monolith as electric swing adsorption to improve indoor air quality;This study explores the feasibility of excess CO2 removal from living spaces. Electric-swing adsorption (ESA) splits ambient air into two portions: waste gas for removal and recovery air for recycling back into the living space. Ambient air holds dilute but unacceptable concentrations of CO2 (selected as 3000 ppm in this study), while the waste gas contains higher concentrations. The concentration in the recovered air is below ambient levels. Carbon monolith functions as an adsorbent and direct heating resistance material. Cooling is accomplished by the convective flow of ambient air. The computational model and preliminary tests establish ways to quantify the separation characteristics and thermal response of the monolith. Based on the ESA steps identified with the single monolith, a prototype of a two-bed device is built to demonstrate the cyclical operation of multiple beds with phase shift. The electrical energy requirement for treating air containing 3000 ppm CO2 is in the range of 57.8 kJ/(m3 air) under the selected temperature swing of 20 degrees C. This requirement indicates that further refinement is essential for practical application. However, the overall findings are in agreement with the well-established fact that the concentration of CO2 is the most important factor affecting energy consumption, especially when the mole fraction of CO2 is less than 0.15.

Functionalized Polysilsesquioxane-Based Hybrid Silica Solid Amine Sorbents for the Regenerative Removal of CO2 from Air;Functionalized polysilsesquioxane-based hybrid silica materials are presented as solid amine sorbents for direct CO2 capture from air. The sorbent was synthesized from amine and vinyl functionalized alkoxysilanes by a simple, energy efficient, and costeffective co-condensation method. The material, containing bound amine functionalities, was found to have a selective CO2 capturing capacity of 1.68 mmol/g from atmospheric air with an adsorption half time of 50 min. This material also showed a maximum adsorption capacity of 2.28 mmol/g in pure CO2 and 1.92 mmol/g in 10% CO2. Desorption started at a temperature as low as 60 degrees C, and complete desorption occurred at 80 degrees C. The sorbent exhibited high recycling ability, and 100 cycles of adsorption/desorption were demonstrated in pure CO2 and 50 cycles in ambient air without any loss in efficiency.;2015;1;0;
Simultaneous Online Measurement of H2O and CO2 in the Humid CO2 Adsorption/Desorption Process;A dew point meter (DP) and an infrared (IR) CO2 analyzer were assembled in a humid CO2 adsorption/desorption system in series for simultaneous online measurements of H2O and CO2, respectively. The humidifier, by using surface-flushing on a saturated brine solution was self-made for the generation of humid air flow. It was found that by this method it became relatively easy to obtain a low H2O content in air flow and that its fluctuation could be reduced compared to the bubbling method. Water calibration for the DP-IR detector is necessary to be conducted for minimizing the measurement error of H2O. It demonstrated that the relative error (RA) for simultaneous online measurements H2O and CO2 in the desorption process is lower than 0.1%. The high RA in the adsorption of H2O is attributed to H2O adsorption on the transfer pipe and amplification of the measurement error. The high accuracy of simultaneous online measurements of H2O and CO2 is promising for investigating their co-adsorption/desorption behaviors, especially for direct CO2 capture from ambient air.;2015;1;0;
CO2 Fixation, Lipid Production, and Power Generation by a Novel Air-Lift-Type Microbial Carbon Capture Cell System;An air-lift-type microbial carbon capture cell (ALMCC) was constructed for the first time by using an air-lift-type photobioreactor as the cathode chamber. The performance of ALMCC in fixing high concentration of CO2, producing energy (power and biodiesel), and removing COD together with nutrients was investigated and compared with the traditional microbial carbon capture cell (MCC) and air-lift-type photobioreactor (ALP). The ALMCC system produced a maximum power density of 972.5 mW.m(-3) and removed 86.69% of COD, 70.52% of ammonium nitrogen, and 69.24% of phosphorus, which indicate that ALMCC performed better than MCC in terms of power generation and wastewater treatment efficiency. Besides, ALMCC demonstrated 9.98- and 1.88-fold increases over ALP and MCC in the CO2 fixation rate, respectively. Similarly, the ALMCC significantly presented a higher lipid productivity compared to those control reactors. More importantly, the preliminary analysis of energy balance suggested that the net energy of the ALMCC system was significantly superior to other systems and could theoretically produce enough energy to cover its consumption. In this work, the established ALMCC system simultaneously achieved the high level of CO2 fixation, energy recycle, and municipal wastewater treatment effectively and efficiently.;2015;1;1;
Characterization of a New Ionic Liquid and Its Use for CO2 Capture from Ambient Air: Studies on Solutions of Diethylenetriamine (DETA) and [DETAH]NO3 in Polyethylene Glycol;The development of effective CO, capture technologies with low environmental impacts has been the focus of much recent research. Additionally, consideration is being given as to how CO2 sorbent systems may be applied to small-scale CO, capture. After developing a useful CO, capture system using the simple amine diethylenetriamine (DETA), we decided to investigate how the nitrate salt of DETA, [DETAH]NO3, with a reported high affinity for CO2 and exhibiting many of the ideal characteristics of an ionic liquid, would compare to DETA in terms of its performance as a CO2 sorbent. As a first step, [DETAH]NO3 was prepared and characterized using X-ray crystallography. For the CO2 capture studies, polyethylene glycol (PEG 200) was chosen as the solvent because of its nonreactivity toward the sorbent and CO2 as well as its low volatility and toxicity. Solutions of both DETA and [DETAH]NO3 in PEG 200 were found to perform optimally at a concentration of roughly 10% (v/v). [DETAH]NO3 proved slightly better for CO, uptake at lower concentrations (5% v/v), while DETA performed better at higher concentrations. However, [DETAH]NO3 was calculated to have a vapor pressure considerably lower than that of DETA over the entire temperature range studied. Both the DETA and [DETAH]NO3 solutions could be regenerated, with no observed degradation, over several heating and cooling cycles. These results, paired with the many favorable physical characteristics of ionic liquids, make [DETAH]NO3 a viable alternative for CO2 capture and ideal for application in small-scale CO2 capture from ambient air.;2015;1;0;
Linking CO2 Sorption Performance to Polymer Morphology in Aminopolymer/Silica Composites through Neutron Scattering;Composites of poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) and mesoporous silica are effective, reversible adsorbents for CO2, both from flue gas and in direct air-capture applications. The morphology of the PEI within the silica can strongly impact the overall carbon capture efficiency and rate of saturation. Here, we directly probe the spatial distribution of the supported polymer through small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). Combined with textural characterization from physisorption analysis, the data indicate that PEI first forms a thin conformal coating on the pore walls, but all additional polymer aggregates into plug(s) that grow along the pore axis. This model is consistent with observed trends in amine-efficiency (CO2/N binding ratio) and pore size distributions, and points to a trade-off between achieving high chemical accessibility of the amine binding sites, which are inaccessible when they strongly interact with the silica, and high accessibility for mass transport, which can be hampered by diffusion through PEI plugs. We illustrate this design principle by demonstrating higher CO2 capacity and uptake rate for PEI supported in a hydrophobically modified silica, which exhibits repulsive interactions with the PEI, freeing up binding sites.;2015;1;0;
Homodiamine-functionalized metal-organic frameworks with a MOF-74-type extended structure for superior selectivity of CO2 over N-2;A porous Mg-2(dondc) framework (H(4)dondc = 1,5-dioxido-2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid) with open metal sites was prepared and functionalized with primary or secondary diamines (en = ethylenediamine, mmen = N,N'-dimethylethylenediamine, or ppz = piperazine). The CO2 adsorption was substantial under post-combustion flue gas conditions as compared to other reported metal-organic frameworks. Interestingly, the IR spectroscopic measurements demonstrated that the CO2 adsorption mechanism is based on the combination of physisorption and chemisorption. The CO2 adsorption capacity of 1-mmen was greater than that of 1-en and 1-ppz, which can likely be attributed to the basicity of the free amine groups tethered to the open coordination sites. Ultrahigh selectivity and superior dynamic separation of CO2 over N-2 were evident in 1-ppz. Such exceptional CO2 uptake and CO2/N-2 selectivity of diamine-unctionalized materials hold potential promise for post-combustion CO2 capture applications.;2015;0;0;
Target-Specific Capture of Environmentally Relevant Gaseous Aldehydes and Carboxylic Acids with Functional Nanoparticles;Aldehyde and carboxylic acid volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present significant environmental concern due to their prevalence in the atmosphere. We developed biodegradable functional nanoparticles comprised of poly(D,L-lactic acid)-poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(ethyleneimine) (PDLLA-PEG-PEI) block co-polymers that capture these VOCs by chemical reaction. Polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) preparation involved nanoprecipitation and surface functionalization with branched PEI. The PDLLA-PEG-PEI NPs were characterized by using TGA, IR, H-1 NMR, elemental analysis, and TEM. The materials feature 1 degrees, 2 degrees, and 3 degrees amines on their surface, capable of capturing aldehydes and carboxylic acids from gaseous mixtures. Aldehydes were captured by a condensation reaction forming imines, whereas carboxylic acids were captured by acid/base reaction. These materials reacted selectively with target contaminants obviating off-target binding when challenged by other VOCs with orthogonal reactivity. The NPs outperformed conventional activated carbon sorbents.;2015;0;0;
Amine-Oxide Hybrid Materials for CO2 Capture from Ambient Air;"CONSPECTUS: Oxide supports functionalized with amine moieties have been used for decades as catalysts and chromatographic media. Owing to the recognized impact of atmospheric CO2 on global climate change, the study of the use of amine-oxide hybrid materials as CO2 sorbents has exploded in the past decade. While the majority of the work has concerned separation of CO2 from dilute mixtures such as flue gas from coal-fired power plants, it has been recognized by us and others that such supported amine materials are also perhaps uniquely suited to extract CO2 from ultradilute gas mixtures, such as ambient air. As unique, low temperature chemisorbents, they can operate under ambient conditions, spontaneously extracting CO2 from ambient air, while being regenerated under mild conditions using heat or the combination of heat and vacuum.This Account describes the evolution of our activities on the design of amine-functionalized silica materials for catalysis to the design, characterization, and utilization of these materials in CO2 separations. New materials developed in our laboratory, such as hyperbranched aminosilica materials, and previously known amine-oxide hybrid compositions, have been extensively studied for CO2 extraction from simulated ambient air (400 ppm of CO2). The role of amine type and structure (molecular, polymeric), support type and structure, the stability of the various compositions under simulated operating conditions, and the nature of the adsorbed CO2 have been investigated in detail. The requirements for an effective, practical air capture process have been outlined and the ability of amine oxide hybrid materials to meet these needs has been discussed. Ultimately, the practicality of such a ""direct air capture"" process is predicated not only on the physicochemical properties of the sorbent, but also how the sorbent operates in a practical process that offers a scalable gas solid contacting strategy. In this regard, the utility of low pressure drop monolith contactors is suggested to offer a practical mode of amine sorbent/air contacting for direct air capture.";2015;1;0;
Functionalization of Metal-Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Stability under Humid Carbon Dioxide Capture Conditions;Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been highlighted recently as promising materials for CO2 capture. However, in practical CO2 capture processes, such as capture from flue gas or ambient air, the adsorption properties of MOFs tend to be harmed by the presence of moisture possibly because of the hydrophilic nature of the coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUSs) within their framework. In this work, the CUSs of the MOF framework are functionalized with amine-containing molecules to prevent structural degradation in a humid environment. Specifically, the framework of the magnesium dioxybenzenedicarboxylate (Mg/DOBDC) MOF was functionalized with ethylenediamine (ED) molecules to make the overall structure less hydrophilic. Structural analysis after exposure to high-temperature steam showed that the ED-functionalized Mg/DOBDC (ED-Mg/DOBDC) is more stable under humid conditions, than Mg/DOBDC, which underwent drastic structural changes. ED-Mg/DOBDC recovered its CO2 adsorption capacity and initial adsorption rate quite well as opposed to the original Mg/DOBDC, which revealed a significant reduction in its capture capacity and kinetics. These results suggest that the amine-functionalization of the CUSs is an effective way to enhance the structural stability of MOFs as well as their capture of humid CO2.;2015;1;0;
Potassium incorporated alumina based CO2 capture sorbents: Comparison with supported amine sorbents under ultra-dilute capture conditions;Amines supported on silica or alumina supports are among the most well-studied sorbents for CO2 capture from ultra-dilute sources, such as ambient air. Another class of sorbents that may also bind CO2 strongly enough to function well under ultra-dilute conditions are supported alkali metal based compositions. In this work, the synthesis of alumina-supported potassium (AlK) via calcination of impregnated potassium acetate is described and the resulting materials are evaluated for CO2 capture under ultra-dilute conditions (1% CO2), including under simulated air capture conditions (400 ppm CO2). The sorbents are evaluated at different adsorption and regeneration temperatures alongside two benchmark alumina-supported amine sorbents. The potassium-alumina sorbents are found to adsorb more CO2 than the amine benchmark sorbent at the tested 1% CO2 conditions, whereas the amine sorbent yielded a higher uptake under simulated air capture conditions of 400 ppm. Abbreviated adsorption isotherms are measured for the potassium-alumina sorbents at three temperatures, the isotherms are fit to a single site Toth adsorption model, and the assembled data are utilized to estimate the heat of adsorption using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. The isosteric heat of adsorption for the potassium based sorbent is higher than those estimated and measured for amine based sorbents, which is consistent with the higher regeneration temperature required by the potassium based sorbents. Potassium-alumina sorbents may be useful adsorbents for ultra-dilute conditions due to their stability in oxygen relative to amine sorbents if plentiful heat is available for the significant temperature swings needed to effectively cycle the sorbents.

Role of Additives in Composite PEI/Oxide CO2 Adsorbents: Enhancement in the Amine Efficiency of Supported PEI by PEG in CO2 Capture from Simulated Ambient Air;Supported amines are promising candidate adsorbents for the removal of CO2 from flue gases and directly from ambient air. The incorporation of additives into polymeric amines such as poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) supported on mesoporous oxides is an effective strategy to improve the performance of the materials. Here, several practical aspects of this strategy are addressed with regards to direct air capture. The influence of three additives (CTAB, PEG200, PEG1000) was systematically explored under dry simulated air capture conditions (400 ppm of CO2, 30 degrees C). With SBA-15 as a model support for poly(ethylenimine) (PEI), the nature of the additive induced heterogeneities in the deposition of organic on the interior and exterior of the particles, an important consideration for future scale up to practical systems. The PEG200 additive increased the observed thermodynamic performance (similar to 60% increase in amine efficiency) of the adsorbents regardless of the PEI content, while the other molecules had less positive effects. A threshold PEG200/PEI value was identified at which the diffusional limitations of CO2 within the materials were nearly eliminated. The threshold PEG/PEI ratio may have physical origin in the interactions between PEI and PEG, as the optimal ratio corresponded to nearly equimolar OH/reactive (1 degrees, 2 degrees) amine ratios. The strategy is shown to be robust to the characteristics of the host support, as PEG200 improved the amine efficiency of PEI when supported on two varieties of mesoporous gamma-alumina with PEI.;2015;1;0;
Capture of atmospheric CO2 into (BiO)(2)CO3/graphene or graphene oxide nanocomposites with enhanced photocatalytic performance;Self-assembly of (BiO)(2)CO3 nanoflakes on graphene (Ge) and graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets, as an effective strategy to improve the photocatalytic performance of two-dimensional (2D) nanostructured materials, were realized by a one-pot efficient capture of atmospheric CO2 at room temperature. The as-synthesized samples were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, UV-vis DRS, Time-resolved ns-level PL and BET-BJH measurement. The photocatalytic activity of the obtained samples was evaluated by the removal of NO at the indoor air level under simulated solar-light irradiation. Compared with pure (BiO)(2)CO3, (BiO)(2)CO3/Ge and ((BiO)(2)CO3/GO nanocompo sites exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity due to their large surface areas and pore volume, and efficient charge separation and transfer. The present work could provide a simple method to construct 2D nanocomposites by efficient utilization of CO2 in green synthetic strategy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2015;1;0;
Direct Air Capture of CO2 by Physisorbent Materials;"Sequestration of CO2, either from gas mixtures or directly from air (direct air capture, DAC), could mitigate carbon emissions. Here five materials are investigated for their ability to adsorb CO2 directly from air and other gas mixtures. The sorbents studied are benchmark materials that encompass four types of porous material, one chemisorbent, TEPA-SBA-15 (amine-modified mesoporous silica) and four physisorbents: Zeolite 13X (inorganic); HKUST-1 and Mg-MOF-74/Mg-dobdc (metal-organic frameworks, MOFs); SIFSIX-3-Ni, (hybrid ultramicroporous material). Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments afforded information about the contents of each sorbent under equilibrium conditions and their ease of recycling. Accelerated stability tests addressed projected shelf-life of the five sorbents. The four physisorbents were found to be capable of carbon capture from CO2-rich gas mixtures, but competition and reaction with atmospheric moisture significantly reduced their DAC performance.";2015;1;0;
CO2 utilization in the perspective of industrial ecology, an overview;Carbon dioxide emissions from anthropic activities have accumulated in the atmosphere in excess of 800 Gigatons since preindustrial times, and are continuously increasing. Among other strategies, CO2 capture and storage is one option to mitigate the emissions from large point sources. In addition, carbon dioxide extraction from ambient air is assessed to reduce the atmospheric concentration of CO2. Both direct and indirect (through photosynthesis) pathways are possible.Geological sequestration has significant disadvantages (high cost, low public acceptance, long term uncertainty) whereas carbon dioxide recycling (or utilization) is more consistent with the basic principle of industrial ecology, almost closing material cycles.In this article, a series of technologies for CO2 capture and valorization is described as integrated and optimized pathways. This integration increases the environmental and economic benefits of each technology. Depending on the source of carbon dioxide, appropriate capture and valorization processes are evaluated based on material and energy constraints. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

CO2 as carbon source for fuel synthesis;"The growing use of fossil fuels (solid, liquid and gas) as the main primary energy sources, inevitably leads to an increasing amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. On the other hand, the increasing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is indicated as the main cause of the greenhouse effect on the planet with consequent climate change. These reasons motivated in recent years growing efforts, from both technical-scientific and political communities, to control the accumulation of the atmospheric CO2. Carbon capture technologies are a well stabilized route to reduce the concentration of the greenhouse gas (CO2) from the atmosphere. However, the introduction of these capture processes always requires additional costs regardless of the adopted technology (post-combustion capture, pre-combustion capture or oxy-combustion). Despite higher costs, the adoption of efficient technologies for capturing CO2 is essential for the preservation of the environment. Besides the capture of CO2, its final sequestration in geologically stable sites is currently proposed for storing enormous quantities of gas involved. However, the geological storage of a given amount of CO2 avoids the possible use of C for about 27% wt. Therefore it seems reasonable to question if we can take advantage of this huge amount of carbon. As a matter of fact, the CO2 could become an important source of carbon for the synthesis of organic and inorganic compounds. In particular, there is a growing interest around the possibility to treat the CO2 in a reducing environment to convert it to methanol or methane. This option is an alternative to the well documented reduction of CO2 to carbon monoxide. Our interest is focused on the conversion to methane by hydrogen reduction. When the hydrogen is obtained by renewable energy, the method is a good way to store the electricity generated from renewable sources such as chemical energy; it is easily accessible and transportable thanks to the widespread presence of methane distribution network. We investigate the hydrogenation of CO2 on various Ni based catalysts. The conversion yield, the time stability and the poison sensitivity has been studied up to the temperature of 723 K and at atmospheric pressure. © 2013 The Authors.";2014;1;1;
Preparation of moisture swing adsorbent and performance test for CO2 capture from ambient air;The moisture swing adsorption is an emerging technology for carbon dioxide separation. A moisture swing adsorbent, as the form of heterogeneous membrane, was prepared with strong based quaternary ammonium resin for direct CO2 capture from ambient air. The charge density and the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent were analyzed through titration method. The apparent structures of the membranes made under different conditions were observed by SEM. Adsorption experiments were conducted to study the performance of carbon dioxide adsorption. The results indicate that the heat treatment can improve obviously the adsorption performance of the adsorbent membrane. The effect of adsorbent preparation on adsorption velocity, adsorption capacity and mechanical property of membrane was studied.

Carbon dioxide capture, utilization and storage (CCUS);Carbon dioxide being the most anthropogenic greenhouse gas,it needs to be isolated from entering into atmosphere. Carbon capture and storage is process that captures CO2 emitted from various sources, separates it from other gases and stores it in a safe place preferably in underground geological formations for large period of time. It is then purified and monitored so that can be made to reuse. Monoethanolamine, zeolitic imidazolate framework, microalgae, membranes etc are utilized to capture CO2. Post-combustion, pre-combustion and oxyfuel combustion along with chemical looping combustion are technologies for scrubbing CO2. The properties of CO2 being easily miscible and readily dissolving in oil with impurities makes it capable for numerous applications such as in producing oil by enhanced oil recovery (EOR), Bio CCS Algal Synthesis etc. CO2-EOR operatiion is capable to produce million barrels of oil and extend the field's lifetime as in case of Weyburn Oil Field in Canada. The physical storage of CO2 is technically the most feasible direction provided that the associated safety and sustainability issues can be met and new materials for CCUS process at low cost are urgently found so that so that fossil based systems with carbon capture are cost competitive.;2014;0;0;
Key technologies of using renewable energy to capture carbon from ambient air directly;Reducing the content of carbon dioxide in air is the key to addressing climate change. Carbon capture and storage is an important measure to reduce carbon dioxide emission. Capturing carbon from ambient air directly needs large amounts of energy. The loads on carbon capture devices are flexible, which to some extent can be driven by intermittent energy. Renewable energy such as wind power and solar energy has great potential for development, which has the characteristics of fluctuation. Using renewable energy to capture carbon from ambient air directly can reduce the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It is a promising way to address global climate change. This paper analyzes the potential of using renewable energy to capture carbon from ambient air directly, and proposes the key technologies of using renewable energy to capture carbon. The planning of using renewable energy to capture carbon is preliminarily studied, and the development trend of carbon capture driven by renewable energy is discussed. © 2014 State Grid Electric Power Research Institute Press;2014;1;1;RE
Ambient temperature sorption of low-concentration carbon dioxide on resin-based solid amine sorbents;Resin-based solid amine sorbents were developed by macroporous adsorption resin impregnated with polyethylenimine (PEI) for regenerative ambient-temperature removal of low concentration CO2. The physicochemical properties of the sorbent were characterized by N2 adsorption/desorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) followed by tests for CO2 capture using TGA and fixed bed experiment. The optimal PEI loading was 50% with a pure CO2 sorption capacity of 175 mg·g-1. The sorption behavior was determined by the kinetic diffusion and thermodynamic sorption. Low temperature favored the thermodynamic sorption and resulted in high sorption capacity. The sorbents had excellent CO2 sorption capacities over the concentration rang of 400 ppm~15%. The sorption capacities as high as 86 mg·g-1 and 150 mg·g-1 were obtained for 400 ppm CO2 and 15% CO2 flow, respectively. The humidity played a promoting role on the sorption capacity of 400 ppm CO2, and a remarkable improvement of 139 mg·g-1 was achieved for a relative humidity of 10%. The sorbents also exhibited stable sorption/desorption cycling performance. All these results suggested that the as-prepared solid amine sorbents had a great potential in room-temperature direct air capture of CO2. ©, 2014, Huanjing Kexue Xuebao/Acta Scientiae Circumstantiae.

Thermodynamic evaluation of supercritical oxy-type power plant with high-temperature three-end membrane for air separation;"Among the technologies which allow to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, mainly of carbon dioxide, special attention deserves the idea of 'zero-emission' technology based on boilers working in oxy-combustion technology. In the paper a thermodynamic analysis of supercritical power plant fed by lignite was made. Power plant consists of: 600 MW steam power unit with live steam parameters of 650 oC/30 MPa and reheated steam parameters of 670 oC/6 MPa; circulating fluidized bed boiler working in oxy-combustion technology; air separation unit and installation of the carbon dioxide compression. Air separation unit is based on high temperature membrane working in three-end technology. Models of steam cycle, circulation fluidized bed boiler, air separation unit and carbon capture installation were made using commercial software. After integration of these models the net electricity generation efficiency as a function of the degree of oxygen recovery in high temperature membrane was analyzed.";2014;0;0;
Using anthropogenic hydrocarbon stock to capture <inf>nano</inf>carbon;This paper summarizes our past achievements in thermo management material solutions’ development, recently venturing into Capture of atmospheric Carbon for Re-Use applications. Climate Change is closely related to the CO<inf>2</inf> stock in atmosphere, nowadays at 550Gt. To stay within the +2°C scenario this atmospheric stock should never go beyond 800Gt [1]. Therefore opportunities to Re-Use atmospheric Carbon stock in substitution of imported fossil Carbon from earlier ages should be explored. Hydrogen-Carbon Synthesis based materials can offer a great opportunity to achieve Carbon offsets > 100% of the feedstock’s Carbon content if transformation efficiencies are favorable. Therefore shifting from mined to Captured Carbon resources could offer one of the greatest economic opportunities to mitigate Climate Change. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.;2014;1;1;
CO2 fertilization system integrated with a low-cost direct air capture technology;An integrated system combined direct air capture (DAC) and greenhouse agriculture is proposed, in which moisture swing adsorption technology is used to concentrate CO2 from the atmosphere and then feed CO2 to the greenhouse. Absorption isotherm study and desorption kinetic study have been achieved in the paper. The results show that the behaviour of membrane conforms to Langmuir model and its capacity reaches to 0.83 mol of CO2 per kilogram of sorbent. When the output CO2 concentration of the desorber is around 1000 ppm, desorption efficiency increases from 71.3% to 79.6% when the temperature is changed from 25°C to 40°C. Besides, based on the experiment of the uptake kinetics of plants under different light and different light intensity, energy consumption and techno-economic analysis of the system have been carried out. © 2014 The Authors.

TG-FTIR Measurement of CO2-H2O co-adsorption for CO2 air capture sorbent screening;Capturing atmospheric CO2 using solid sorbents is gaining interest. As ambient air normally contains much more (up to 100 times) water than CO2, a selective sorbent is desirable as co-adsorption will most likely occur. In this study, a convenient method based on an TG-FTIR analysis system is developed and used to characterize sorbents for their water and CO2 adsorption capacity when exposed to ambient air. The method allows to determine quantitatively the co-adsorbed amounts of CO2 and water from small sample sizes (10 mg range) and is expected to be a useful instrument in sorbent screening and evaluation. © 2014 The Authors.

Carbon-negative options;Considering the slow progress of current carbon mitigation policies, there is a growing recognition that the low-risk levels of atmospheric CO2 cannot be achieved without a significant carbon-negative component. Among the proposed carbon-negative solutions, bioenergy coupled with carbon capture and storage (Bio-CCS) is the most technologically advanced option. The conversion of biomass to biochar associated with negative CO2 emissions is another promising approach in the context of carbon abatement policies. Removal of CO2 from atmosphere (air capture) by chemical systems as a carbon-negative option is still in the early stage of technological development and would require the increased industrial and government support for pilot and demonstration-scale projects to drive its costs down. The current scientific and technological status, economic and environmental aspects, as well as opportunities for Bio-CCS, biochar, air capture as carbon-negative solutions are analyzed in this chapter. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.;2014;1;1;X

Porous polymers prepared via high internal phase emulsion polymerization for reversible CO2 capture;A series of porous polymers with different pore volumes, pore sizes, and crosslinking densities were synthesized by high internal phase emulsion (HIPE) polymerization. The crosslinked polymerized HIPEs (polyHIPEs) were formed by the copolymerization of 4-vinylbenzyl chloride and divinylbenzene using water droplets in conventional or Pickering HIPEs as the templates. These porous materials were further modified by quaternization and ion exchange to introduce quaternary ammonium hydroxide groups. The resulting polyHIPEs were utilized as sorbents for reversible CO2 capture from air using the humidity swing. The effect of pore structure on the CO2 adsorption and desorption processes was studied. The polyHIPEs containing large pores and interconnected porous structures showed improved swing sizes and faster adsorption/desorption kinetics of CO2 compared to a commercial Excellion membrane with similar functional groups.

Quantification of trace element emissions from low-carbon emission energy sources: (I) Ca-looping cycle for post-combustion CO2 capture and (II) fixed bed, air blown down-draft gasifier;The integrated technologies of gasification and the calcium looping cycle represent the opportunity to produce H-2 as an energy carrier while ensuring inherent CO2 capture, thus producing a near-zero or negative emission fuel. Gasification of waste-derived fuel including demolition wood and low density plastic is gaining in interest due to the potential to minimise waste to landfill, whilst also representing a carbon-neutral energy source. However, potential trace element emissions from the gasification of such fuels require investigation to ensure compliance with targets under the El) Ambient Air Quality Directive 2008 and the UK Air Quality Standards Regulations 2010. Likewise, contaminants present in limestone have the potential to be released to the environment under the operating regimes required for carbonation and calcination in the calcium looping cycle for CO2 capture. Solid samples (offline), liquids (offline) and gaseous (offline/online and in-situ mobile ICP-OES) products from a pilot scale fixed bed, air-blown clown-draft gasifier and from a pilot scale CO2 capture reactor comprising of the calcium looping cycle, have been collected and analysed in order to gain further understanding of the likely trace element partitioning in both processes. Results showed that a number of trace element contaminants present in the original CO2 sorbent and gasifier fuel samples were also present in the flue gas from both the CO2 capture and gasification processes, implying that integration of the technologies may result in enhanced contamination in the final gaseous product. The main outputs of this study assist in analysing plant requirements, for example gas cleaning, and identifying the environmental emissions and residual disposal. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Diamine-functionalized metal-organic framework: exceptionally high CO2 capacities from ambient air and flue gas, ultrafast CO2 uptake rate, and adsorption mechanism;"A framework en-Mg-2(dobpdc) (1-en; en = ethylenediamine) functionalized with the primary amine en was prepared via postmodification. From synchrotron PXRD data, it is revealed that the cell parameters change upon grafting of en and CO2 uptake. The adsorbed CO2 amount of 1-en is 4.57 mmol g(-1) (16.7 wt%) at 25 degrees C and 1 bar and decreases to 3.00 mmol g(-1) (11.7 wt%) at 150 degrees C. Noticeably, 1-en shows a significant CO2 uptake (3.62 mmol g(-1), 13.7 wt%) at 0.15 bar, which is comparable to the CO2 partial pressure of a post-combustion flue gas. The CO2 capacity of 1-en at 0.39 mbar, close to atmospheric CO2 concentration, is 2.83 mmol g(-1) (11.1 wt%), which marks the highest amount among MOFs. The isosteric heat of adsorption (-Q(st)) of 1-en in CO2 capture corresponds to 49-51 kJ mol(-1), which is supported by DFT calculations (-52.8 kJ mol(-1)). These results suggest that the adsorption of CO2 onto the free amines of en leads to the formation of a carbamic acid. Adsorption-desorption cyclings of CO2 at the real dilute concentrations of air and flue gas are established with almost retaining CO2 capacities, which could provide superior potential for practical application in CO2 capture. The adsorption rate of CO2 in 1-en exceeds that in some other tested porous materials. The recyclability in CO2 uptake for 1-en is maintained even after exposure to humidity.";2014;1;0;
Single-Component and Binary CO2 and H2O Adsorption of Amine-Functionalized Cellulose;A fundamental analysis of single-component and binary CO2 and H2O adsorption of amine-functionalized nanofibrillated cellulose is carried out in the temperature range of 283-353 K and at CO2 partial pressures in the range of 0.02-105 kPa, where the ultralow partial pressure range is relevant for the direct capture of CO2 from atmospheric air. Single-component CO2 and H2O adsorption experimental data are fitted to the Toth and Guggenheim-Anderson-de Boer models, respectively. Corresponding heats of adsorption, derived from explicit solutions of the van't Hoff equation, are -50 kJ/mol CO2 and -48.8 kJ/mol H2O. Binary CO2/H2O adsorption measurements for humid air reveal that the presence of H2O at 2.55 kPa enhances CO2 adsorption, while the presence of CO2 at 0.045 kPa does not influence H2O adsorption. The energy demand of the temperature-vacuum-swing adsorption/desorption cycle for delivering pure CO2 from air increases significantly with H2O adsorption and indicates the need to reduce the hygroscopicity of the adsorbent.;2014;1;0;
Determination of Carbon- based Engineered Nanoparticles in Marketed Fishby Microwave- assisted Extraction and Liquid Chromatography- atmosphericPressure Photoionization- tandem Mass Spectrometry;An optimized method for the determination of two major carbon-based engineered nanoparticles (C-60 and C-70) in marketed fish samples is described. The method involves the use of microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) coupled with liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry with atmospheric pressure photoionization (LC-APPI-MS/MS). Factors affecting the extraction efficiency of the analytes from fish samples were optimized by a central composite design method. The optimal extraction temperature and time for MAE were found to be 233 degrees C for 22 min, and the extraction solution was composed of toluene and acetone in a ratio of 4.64:1. The limits of quantitation (LOQs) were 0.1 and 0.05 ng/g for C-60 and C-70, respectively. The precision for these analytes at two spiked levels, as indicated by relative standard deviations (RSDs), were less than 10% for both intra- and inter-day analysis. Accuracy, expressed as the mean extraction recovery, was between 85 and 98%. The method was further validated based on EU Commission Decision 2002/657/EC, including a decision limit (CC) and detection capability (CC) for marketed fish samples.;2014;1;0;
Amine-Tethered Adsorbents Based on Three-Dimensional Macroporous Silica for CO2 Capture from Simulated Flue Gas and Air;New covalently tethered CO2 adsorbents are synthesized through the in situ polymerization of N-carboxyanhydride (NCA) of L-alanine from amine-functionalized three-dimensional (3D) interconnected macroporous silica (MPS). The interconnected macropores provide low-resistant pathways for the diffusion of CO2 molecules, while the abundant mesopores ensure the high pore volume. The adsorbents exhibit high molecular weight (of up to 13058 Da), high amine loading (more than 10.98 mmol N g(-1)), fast CO2 capture kinetics (t(1/2) < 1 min), high adsorption capacity (of up to 3.86 mmol CO2 g(-1) in simulated flue gas and 2.65 mmol CO2 g(-1) in simulated ambient air under 1 atm of dry CO2), as well as good stability over 120 adsorption-desorption cycles, which allows the overall CO2 capture process to be promising and sustainable.;2014;1;0;
Study on microporous supported ionic liquid membranes for carbon dioxide capture;To capture carbon dioxide directly from ambient air, the fabrication of supported ionic liquid membranes (SILMs) on asymmetric and symmetric microporous poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membranes were studied. The effect of support membrane structure on the IL loading, the stability of fabricated SILMs, and the carbon dioxide (CO2) capturing abilities of both SILMs were evaluated. The evaluations include the gas permeation of pure CO2 and nitrogen (N-2), the mixed CO2-N-2 gases containing 50%, 10% and 1% CO2, and the directly compressed ambient air. The results demonstrated that pure CO2 showed the highest permeance, followed by CO2-air and then N-2. Compared with asymmetric SILMs which had higher gas permeance, the symmetric SILMs had better selectivity for CO2/N-2, to more than 20 of CO2/N-2 selectivity, for both single and mixed gases. The SILMs also were found to be capable of capturing CO2 from air from 2 to more than 5 of CO2/air selectivity for separation of air enriched with low CO2 concentrations (10%, 1% and zero) as the transmembrane pressure increased to 0.25 MPa. Thus, this work might provide a potential method for sequestering CO2 directly from atmosphere to avoid the need for extensive CO2-transportation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Direct CO2 capture from ambient air using K2CO3/Y2O3 composite sorbent;Carbonate-bicarbonate looping was tested for direct CO2 capture from air using a composite sorbent K2CO3/Y2O3. The phase composition, the porous structure and the texture of the composite sorbent were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction, mercury intrusion and scanning electron microscopy methods. The thermal properties of the sorbent were additionally studied by X-ray diffraction in situ and thermogravimetry methods. CO2 absorption from air and desorption experiments were performed in a continuous-flow system. The effect of regeneration temperature on CO2 uptake was investigated. It was shown that CO2 absorption uptake from air is about 28 mg (CO2)/g in temperature swing absorption cycles within regeneration temperature range of 150-250 degrees C. However, the increase of the regeneration temperature up to 300 degrees C results in gradual decrease of the absorption uptake down to 10 mg (CO2)/g. The XRD pattern of the cycled sample contains a set of reflections that cannot be assigned to any known potassium-or yttrium-containing crystalline phase. The new phase, which is thermally stable up to 460 degrees C, accumulates potassium ions and is, probably, responsible for the sorbent capacity decay. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Revisiting film theory to consider approaches for enhanced solvent-process design for carbon capture;Application of carbon capture at the gigaton-scale necessary for significant reduction in atmospheric CO2 requires a portfolio of technologies for applications that may span point-source capture to more dilute systems such as CO2 removal from the atmosphere. We argue that for absorption separation processes there is a strong coupling between the solvent and process properties, which are uniquely dependent upon the starting concentration of CO2. We revisit Whitman's film theory and consider mass-transfer correlations to determine the most critical solvent and process parameters that influence the flux of CO2 from the gas to the liquid phase, within which it is ultimately captured. Finally, results of this work indicate, for instance, that increasing the kinetics of a reacting solvent with CO2 has a greater impact on direct air capture (DAC) systems, than natural gas-or coal-fired power plant emissions. In addition, the solvent kinetics is a more influential parameter than the Henry's law solubility coefficient for DAC systems, while the reverse may be found for more concentrated CO2 gas mixtures.;2014;1;0;
Easily Regenerable Solid Adsorbents Based on Polyamines for Carbon Dioxide Capture from the Air;Adsorbents prepared easily by impregnation of fumed silica with polyethylenimine (PEI) are promising candidates for the capture of CO2 directly from the air. These inexpensive adsorbents have high CO2 adsorption capacity at ambient temperature and can be regenerated in repeated cycles under mild conditions. Despite the very low CO2 concentration, they are able to scrub efficiently all CO2 out of the air in the initial hours of the experiments. The influence of parameters such as PEI loading, adsorption and desorption temperature, particle size, and PEI molecular weight on the adsorption behavior were investigated. The mild regeneration temperatures required could allow the use of waste heat available in many industrial processes as well as solar heat. CO2 adsorption from the air has a number of applications. Removal of CO2 from a closed environment, such as a submarine or space vehicles, is essential for life support. The supply of CO2-free air is also critical for alkaline fuel cells and batteries. Direct air capture of CO2 could also help mitigate the rising concerns about atmospheric CO2 concentration and associated climatic changes, while, at the same time, provide the first step for an anthropogenic carbon cycle.;2014;1;0;
Carbon Recycling for Renewable Materials and Energy Supply Recent Trends, Long-Term Options, and Challenges for Research and Development;The current flow of carbon for the production, use, and waste management of polymer-based products is still mostly linear from the lithosphere to the atmosphere with rather low rates of material recycling. In view of a limited future supply of biomass, this article outlines the options to further develop carbon recycling (C-REC). The focus is on carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and use for synthesis of platform chemicals to produce polymers. CO2 may be captured from exhaust gases after combustion or fermentation of waste in order to establish a C-REC system within the technosphere. As a long-term option, an external C-REC system can be developed by capturing atmospheric CO2. A central role may be expected from renewable methane (or synthetic natural gas), which is increasingly being used for storage and transport of energy, but may also be used for renewable carbon supply for chemistry. The energy input for the C-REC processes can come from wind and solar systems, in particular, power for the production of hydrogen, which is combined with CO2 to produce various hydrocarbons. Most of the technological components for the system already exist, and, first modules for renewable fuel and polymer production systems are underway in Germany. This article outlines how the system may further develop over the medium to long term, from a piggy-back add-on flow system toward a self-carrying recycling system, which has the potential to provide the material and energy backbone of future societies. A critical bottleneck seems to be the capacity and costs of renewable energy supply, rather than the costs of carbon capture.;2014;1;1;
CO2 capture: Value functions, separative work and process economics;"The relationship between the thermodynamic minimum work of separation and the ""separative work"" from the theory of staged separation processes is examined. These functions show similar patterns of concentration dependence over much of the range but they diverge at the extremes of high and low concentrations with the result that, for separation processes in which a pure product is extracted from a low concentration feed, the ""separative work"" is substantially greater than the thermodynamic minimum. The implications for CO2 capture, both from stack gas and from the atmosphere, are examined in detail. It is shown that, according to this model, the separative work required for direct air capture (per mole of CO2) is substantially greater than the thermodynamic minimum and may be as much as 100 times greater than the energy required for capture from the stack gas of a coal fired power plant.

Steam Induced Structural Changes of a Poly(ethylenimine) Impregnated gamma-Alumina Sorbent for CO2 Extraction from Ambient Air;"Poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) impregnated mesoporous gamma-alumina sorbents are utilized for CO2 adsorption from dry and humid simulated ambient air, and the sorbents are regenerated under an environment of flowing steam for times ranging from 5 min to 24 h of continuous exposure. The sorbents are compared on the basis of equilibrium CO2 capacities from simulated air at 400 ppm of CO2, 50% relative humidity, and 30 degrees C as well as their physiochemical characterization by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Al-27 NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, N-2 physisorption, and elemental analysis. The sorbents retain better than 90% of the initial equilibrium capacity of similar to 1.7 mmol/g at steam exposure times up to 12 h; however, PEI leaching reduced the capacity of the sorbent to 0.66 mmol/g after 24 h of continuous treatment. It is demonstrated that the gamma-alumina support partially hydrates to form a boehmite crystal phase at steam times of 90 min and longer but that this phase transition occurs predominately between 90 min and 12 h of steam treatment, slowing at longer times of 12 and 24 h of treatment. Evidence is presented to suggest that the presence of boehmite on the sorbent surface does not significantly alter the amine efficiency of impregnated PEI. The collected results suggest that gamma-alumina/PEI composite materials are promising sorbents for CO2 capture from ambient air with regeneration in flowing steam.";2014;1;0;
Process and Cost Analysis of a Biomass Power Plant with in Situ Calcium Looping CO2 Capture Process;A novel concept is presented to capture CO2 from a large-scale (>100 MWe) dedicated biomass-fired power plant by using CaO as the CO2 sorbent. Biomass is burnt in a circulating fluidized bed at sufficiently low temperature to allow in situ CO2 capture at atmospheric pressure. The product, CaCO3, is then calcined in an interconnected oxy-fuel combustor, or calciner, that delivers CO2 ready for subsequent purification, compression, and permanent geological storage. A detailed process analysis using Honeywell's UniSim R400 is carried out to reveal process performance and economics of the proposed power plant which is compared against biomass-air-fired and biomass-oxy-fired power plants. A heat exchanger network is designed using a pinch analysis aimed at the recovery of the maximum amount of excess heat from high temperature gas and solid streams in the plant, while the recovered heat is transferred into a subcritical steam cycle for power generation. The entire process simulation also includes a CO2 purification and compression unit that allows reaching more than 95 mol % CO2 purity. The close similarity of the system with commercial coal based CFB power plants enables us to evaluate costs of electricity and CO2 avoided in detail. This process is capable of achieving 84% overall CO2 capture efficiency with additional cost of 43 (sic)/ton CO2 avoided excluding green certificate and European Trading Scheme (ETS) CO2 incentives. If current typical values for these subsidies are included, the avoided cost can even take negative values. The biomass-air-fired plant becomes the most attractive option when only green certificates are introduced. The biomass-oxy-fired and in situ calcium looping plants largely improve their economics when ETS price for CO2 credits increases. The in situ calcium looping option becomes slightly more economical and more flexible to adapt to different market conditions affecting the economic incentives to use biomass for power generation when the biomass plant is colocated with an oxy-fired coal power plant.;2014;0;0;
Made-to-order metal-organic frameworks for trace carbon dioxide removal and air capture;Direct air capture is regarded as a plausible alternate approach that, if economically practical, can mitigate the increasing carbon dioxide emissions associated with two of the main carbon polluting sources, namely stationary power plants and transportation. Here we show that metal-organic framework crystal chemistry permits the construction of an isostructural metal-organic framework (SIFSIX-3-Cu) based on pyrazine/copper(II) two-dimensional periodic 4(4) square grids pillared by silicon hexafluoride anions and thus allows further contraction of the pore system to 3.5 versus 3.84 angstrom for the parent zinc(II) derivative. This enhances the adsorption energetics and subsequently displays carbon dioxide uptake and selectivity at very low partial pressures relevant to air capture and trace carbon dioxide removal. The resultant SIFSIX-3-Cu exhibits uniformly distributed adsorption energetics and offers enhanced carbon dioxide physical adsorption properties, uptake and selectivity in highly diluted gas streams, a performance, to the best of our knowledge, unachievable with other classes of porous materials.;2014;1;0;

Reactivity during bench-scale combustion of biomass fuels for carbon capture and storage applications;"Reactivities of four biomass samples were investigated in four combustion atmospheres using non-isothermal thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under two heating rates. The chosen combustion atmospheres reflect carbon capture and storage (CCS) applications and include O-2 and CO2-enrichment. Application of the Coats-Redfern method assessed changes in reactivity. Reactivity varied due to heating rate: the reactivity of char oxidation was lower at higher heating rates while devolatilisation reactions were less affected. In general, and particularly at the higher heating rate, increasing [O-2] increased combustion reactivity. A lesser effect was observed when substituting N-2 for CO2 as the comburent; in unenriched conditions this tended to reduce char oxidation reactivity while in O-2-enriched conditions the reactivity marginally increased. Combustion in a typical, dry oxyfuel environment (30% O-2, 70% CO2) was more reactive than in air in TGA experiments. These biomass results should interest researchers seeking to understand phenomena occurring in larger scale CCS-relevant experiments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.";2014;0;0;
Capturing CO2 from ambient air using a polyethyleneimine-silica adsorbent in fluidized beds;"Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) uses a combination of technologies to capture, transport and store carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from large point sources such as coal or natural gas-fired power plants. Capturing CO2 from ambient air has been considered as a carbon-negative technology to mitigate anthropogenic CO2 emissions in the air. The performance of a mesoporous silica-supported polyethyleneimine (PEI)-silica adsorbent for CO2 capture from ambient air has been evaluated in a laboratory-scale Bubbling Fluidized Bed (BFB) reactor. The air capture tests lasted for between 4 and 14 days using 1 kg of the PEI-silica adsorbent in the BFB reactor. Despite the low CO2 concentration in ambient air, nearly 100% CO2 capture efficiency has been achieved with a relatively short gas-solid contact time of 7.5 s. The equilibrium CO2 adsorption capacity for air capture was found to be as high as 73 wt%, which is amongst the highest values reported to date. A conceptual design is completed to evaluate the technological and economic feasibility of using PEI-silica adsorbent to capture CO2 from ambient air at a large scale of capturing 1 Mt-CO2 per year. The proposed novel ""PEI-CFB air capture system"" mainly comprises a Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB) adsorber and a BFB desorber with a CO2 capture capacity of 40 t-CO2/day. Large pressure drop is required to drive the air through the CFB adsorber and also to suspend and circulate the solid adsorbents within the loop, resulting in higher electricity demand than other reported air capture systems. However, the Temperature Swing Adsorption (TSA) technology adopted for the regeneration strategy in the separate BFB desorber has resulted in much smaller thermal energy requirement. The total energy required is 6.6 GJ/t-CO2 which is comparable to other reference air capture systems. By projecting a future scenario where decarbonization of large point energy sources has been largely implemented by integration of CCS technologies, the operating cost under this scenario is estimated to be $108/t-CO2 captured and $152/t-CO2 avoided with an avoided fraction of 0.71. Further research on the proposed 40 t-CO2/day 'PEI-CFB Air Capture System' is still needed which should include the evaluation of the capital costs and the experimental investigation of air capture using a laboratory-scale CFB system with the PEI-silica adsorbent.

Important Roles of Enthalpic and Entropic Contributions to CO2 Capture from Simulated Flue Gas and Ambient Air Using Mesoporous Silica Grafted Amines;The measurement of isosteric heats of adsorption of silica supported amine materials in the low pressure range (0-0.1 bar) is critical for understanding the interactions between CO2 and amine sites at low coverage and hence to the development of efficient amine adsorbents for CO2 capture from flue gas and ambient air. Heats of adsorption for an array of silica-supported amine materials are experimentally measured at low coverage using a Calvet calorimeter equipped with a customized dosing manifold. In a series of 3-aminopropyl-functionalized silica materials, higher amine densities resulted in higher isosteric heats of adsorption, clearly showing that the density/proximity of amine sites can influence the amine efficiency of adsorbents. In a series of materials with fixed amine loading but different amine types, strongly basic primary and secondary amine materials are shown to have essentially identical heats of adsorption near 90 kJ/mol. However, the adsorption uptakes vary substantially as a function of CO2 partial pressure for different primary and secondary amines, demonstrating that entropic contributions to adsorption may play a key role in adsorption at secondary amine sites, making adsorption at these sites less efficient at the low coverages that are important to the direct capture of CO2 from ambient air. Thus, while primary amines are confirmed to be the most effective amine types for CO2 capture from ambient air, this is not due to enhanced enthalpic contributions associated with primary amines over secondary amines, but may be due to unfavorable entropic factors associated with organization of the second alkyl chain on the secondary amine during CO2 adsorption. Given this hypothesis, favorable entropic factors may be the main reason primary amine based adsorbents are more effective under air capture conditions.;2014;1;0;
An overview of current status of carbon dioxide capture and storage technologies;Global warming and climate change concerns have triggered global efforts to reduce the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is considered a crucial strategy for meeting CO2 emission reduction targets. In this paper, various aspects of CCS are reviewed and discussed including the state of the art technologies for CO2 capture, separation, transport, storage, leakage, monitoring, and life cycle analysis. The selection of specific CO2 capture technology heavily depends on the type of CO2 generating plant and fuel used. Among those CO2 separation processes, absorption is the most mature and commonly adopted due to its higher efficiency and lower cost. Pipeline is considered to be the most viable solution for large volume of CO2 transport. Among those geological formations for CO2 storage, enhanced oil recovery is mature and has been practiced for many years but its economical viability for anthropogenic sources needs to be demonstrated. There are growing interests in CO2 storage in saline aquifers due to their enormous potential storage capacity and several projects are in the pipeline for demonstration of its viability. There are multiple hurdles to CCS deployment including the absence of a clear business case for CCS investment and the absence of robust economic incentives to support the additional high capital and operating costs of the whole CCS process.

Micro/Mesoporous Activated Carbons Derived from Polyaniline: Promising Candidates for CO2 Adsorption;A series of activated carbons were prepared by carbonization of polyaniline at different temperatures, using KOH or K2CO3 as activating agent. Pure microporous or micro/mesoporous activated carbons were obtained depending on the preparation conditions. Carbonization temperature has been proven to be a key parameter to define the textural properties of the carbon when using KOH. Low carbonization temperatures (400650 degrees C) yield materials with a highly developed micro- and mesoporous structure, whereas high temperatures (800 degrees C) yield microporous carbons. Some of the materials prepared using KOH exhibit a BET surface area superior to 4000 m(2)/g, with total pore volume exceeding 2.5 cm(3)/g, which are among the largest found for activated carbons. On the other hand, microporous materials are obtained when using K2CO3, independently of carbonization temperature. Some of the materials were tested for CO2 capture due to their high microporosity and N content. The adsorption capacity for CO2 at atmospheric pressure and 0 degrees C achieves a value of similar to 7.6 mmol CO2/g, which is among the largest reported in the literature. This study provides guidelines for the design of activated carbons with a proper N/C ratio for CO2 capture at atmospheric pressure.;2014;1;0;
Reducing the Cost of Ca-Based Direct Air Capture of CO2;"Direct air capture, the chemical removal of CO2 directly from the atmosphere, may play a role in mitigating future climate risk or form the basis of a sustainable transportation infrastructure. The current discussion is centered on the estimated cost of the technology and its link to ""overshoot"" trajectories, where atmospheric CO2 levels are actively reduced later in the century. The American Physical Society (APS) published a report, later updated, estimating the cost of a one million tonne CO2 per year air capture facility constructed today that highlights several fundamental concepts of chemical air capture. These fundamentals are viewed through the lens of a chemical process that cycles between removing CO2 from the air and releasing the absorbed CO2 in concentrated form. This work builds on the APS report to investigate the effect of modifications to the air capture system based on suggestions in the report and subsequent publications. The work shows that reduced carbon electricity and plastic packing materials (for the contactor) may have significant effects on the overall price, reducing the APS estimate from $610 to $309/tCO(2) avoided. Such a reduction does not challenge postcombustion capture from point sources, estimated at $80/tCO(2), but does make air capture a feasible alternative for the transportation sector and a potential negative emissions technology. Furthermore, air capture represents atmospheric reductions rather than simply avoided emissions";2014;1;1;costs
A thermodynamic analysis of the fuel synthesis system with CO2 direct captured from atmosphere;Hydrocarbon fuel synthesis with renewable energy and captured CO2 is a promising option for CCU and an important approach to sustainable energy. Like photosynthesis of plants, the technology of CO2 direct captured from atmosphere with CO2 utilization would close the carbon cycle thoroughly. Because of the dilute CO2 in the atmosphere, the air capture process faces the challenge of high energy penalty. However, integrated with fuel synthesis process, the air capture process can take advantage of the waste heat produced by syngas production process and the transportation of CO2 can also be avoided. In this study, a thermodynamic model of the fuel synthesis system is built through energy and exergy analysis. The thermodynamic contribution of three typical CO2 capture technologies, moisture swing air capture, high-temperature swing air capture and traditional amine-based flue gas capture, is studied using the model built. Furthermore, by the sensitivity analysis of the critical parameters of the capture, electrolysis and heat exchange process, the influence of each process on the performance of fuel synthesis system is examined and the approach to improve the efficiency of the total system is proposed. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.;2014;1;0;
Algal biorefineries: Volume 1: Cultivation of cells and products;Over the past century, the majority of chemical and energy needs of our industrial society has originated from fossilized carbon sources (coal, crude oil, natural gas). Increasingly, there is a realization that utilization of the fossilized carbon sources has adverse environmental consequences in the form of increasing concentration of greenhouse gases. We are also becoming aware of the limited nature of these resources. As a result, considerable efforts are being made to produce chemicals and fuels from renewable resources such as forest products, agricultural residues and plant products. All of these systems capture solar energy and atmospheric carbon dioxide as a part of the natural carbon cycle. Serious research efforts are also underway, targeting cultivation of photosynthetic autotrophic microbes for the production of biomass and lipids. In this category, algae appears to offer the most potential for capturing solar energy and atmospheric carbon dioxide and delivering sufficient quantities of biomass/lipids that can offset the fossilized carbon utilization in a meaningful manner without impacting food output adversely. However, several advances, both technologically as well as politically, are needed before we can realize its full potential. It is also clear that a biorefinery approach must be undertaken in order to harvest renewable energy and chemicals from algae economically. This edited, multi-authored volume on Algal Biorefineries will document new advances involving algae-based technology. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.;2014;1;1;potential
A model of plant isoprene emission based on available reducing power captures responses to atmospheric CO2;We present a unifying model for isoprene emission by photosynthesizing leaves based on the hypothesis that isoprene biosynthesis depends on a balance between the supply of photosynthetic reducing power and the demands of carbon fixation.We compared the predictions from our model, as well as from two other widely used models, with measurements of isoprene emission from leaves of Populus nigra and hybrid aspen (Populus tremula x P. tremuloides) in response to changes in leaf internal CO2 concentration (C-i) and photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) under diverse ambient CO2 concentrations (C-a).Our model reproduces the observed changes in isoprene emissions with C-i and PPFD, and also reproduces the tendency for the fraction of fixed carbon allocated to isoprene to increase with increasing PPFD. It also provides a simple mechanism for the previously unexplained decrease in the quantum efficiency of isoprene emission with increasing C-a.Experimental and modelled results support our hypothesis. Our model can reproduce the key features of the observations and has the potential to improve process-based modelling of isoprene emissions by land vegetation at the ecosystem and global scales.;2014;0;0;
Effect of light supply on CO2 capture from atmosphere by Chlorella vulgaris and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata;"Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the primary greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. Consequently, emission reduction technologies will be needed to reduce CO2 atmospheric concentration. Microalgae may have an important role in this context. They are photosynthetic microorganisms that are able to fix atmospheric CO2 using solar energy with efficiency ten times higher than terrestrial plants. The objectives of this study were: (i) to analyse the effect of light supply on the growth of Chlorella vulgaris and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata; (ii) to assess the atmospheric CO2 capture by these microalgae; and (iii) to determine the parameters of the Monod model that describe the influence of irradiance on the growth of the selected microalgae. Both microalgae presented higher growth rates with high irradiance values and discontinuous light supply. The continuous supply of light at the highest irradiance value was not beneficial for C. vulgaris due to photooxidation. Additionally, C. vulgaris achieved the highest CO2 fixation rate with the value of 0.305 g-CO2 L-1 d(-1). The parameters of the Monod model demonstrated that C. vulgaris can achieve higher specific growth rates (and higher CO2 fixation rates) if cultivated under higher irradiances than the studied values. The presented results showed that microalgal culture is a promising strategy for CO2 capture from atmosphere.";2014;1;0;algae photo
Coordinated regulation of photosynthesis in rice increases yield and tolerance to environmental stress;Plants capture solar energy and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) through photosynthesis, which is the primary component of crop yield, and needs to be increased considerably to meet the growing global demand for food. Environmental stresses, which are increasing with climate change, adversely affect photosynthetic carbon metabolism (PCM) and limit yield of cereals such as rice (Oryza sativa) that feeds half the world. To study the regulation of photosynthesis, we developed a rice gene regulatory network and identified a transcription factor HYR (HIGHER YIELD RICE) associated with PCM, which on expression in rice enhances photosynthesis under multiple environmental conditions, determining a morpho-physiological programme leading to higher grain yield under normal, drought and high-temperature stress conditions. We show HYR is a master regulator, directly activating photosynthesis genes, cascades of transcription factors and other downstream genes involved in PCM and yield stability under drought and high-temperature environmental stress conditions.;2014;0;0;rice photosynth
Axial compression for direct capture of carbon dioxide (CO2);One prospective method to retard the speed of climate change is Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). It is known that reducing emissions through CCS on point sources can only slowdown the rate of increase of atmospheric CO2 concentration and not able to mitigate the CO2 that are already in the atmosphere by previous emissions. Hence, a complimentary method would be to extract CO2 directly from air - Direct Air Capture (DAC). This paper addresses a novel concept of DAC whereby an additional phase of axial compression is introduced to adapt atmospheric air to a level suitable for capture. An axial compression model was developed so that fluid simulation studies can be performed. These information are then utilized in a feasibility study to address several key issues: the additional energy penalty when applying axial compression and whether or not, increasing the capture input by compression would displace the elevated energy consumption. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.;2013;0;0;
Numerical simulation of long-term fate of CO2 stored in deep reservoir rocks on massively parallel vector supercomputer;"As one of the promising approaches for reducing greenhouse-gas content in the atmosphere, CCS (carbon dioxide capture and storage) has been recognized worldwide. CO2 is captured from large emission sources and injected and stored in deep reservoir rocks, including saline aquifers, depleted oil and gas field. Under typical pressure and temperature conditions at deep reservoirs (depths &gt; 800m), CO2 will be stored in supercritical state, subsequently dissolving in groundwater, and eventually forming carbonate minerals through geochemical reactions in a long-term (e.g., thousands of years). To ensure the safety and permanence of the storage, numerical simulation is considered as the most powerful approach for predicting the long-term fate of CO2 in reservoirs. A parallelized general-purpose hydrodynamics code TOUGH2-MP has been used on scalar architectures where it exhibits excellent performance and scalability. However, on the Earth Simulator (ES2), which is a massively parallel vector computer, extensive tune-ups were required for increasing the vector operation ratio. In this paper, the performance of the modified TOUGH2-MP code on ES2 is presented with some illustrative numerical simulations of long-term fate of CO2 stored in reservoirs. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.";2013;0;0;
Overview of axial compression technology for direct capture of CO2;Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is one of the global leading methods that could potentially retard the speed of climate change. However, CCS on point sources can only slowdown the rate of increase of atmospheric CO2 concentration. In order to mitigate CO2 released by previous emissions, a more proactive alternative is proposed where CO2 is directly extracted and captured from air - Direct Air Capture (DAC). This paper presents a technical overview from our current research of a novel DAC concept which features a phase of axial compression to adapt pre-capture atmospheric air to a level suitable for carbon capture. Also detailed in the paper is the feasibility study addressing several key issues: the energy consumption and overall capturing efficiency of the proposed DAC system. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.;2013;1;1;
Influance of chosen working parameters of gas turbine unit used in air separation unit on efficiency of oxy-fuel supercritical power plant;The supercritical power plant analyzed in this paper, contains the following elements: steam turbine, hard coal fired oxy-type pulverized fuel boiler, carbon dioxide capture unit, air separation unit with: four-end type high-temperature membrane and gas turbine unit. Gross electric power of the power plant is equal to 600 MW. The live steam thermodynamic parameters are 650 °C/30 MPa and the reheated steam parameters are 670 °C/6 MPa. Under the assumption of constant gross power of the analyzed power plant among others, a thermal boiler efficiency, a gross efficiency of the power plant and auxiliary powers of mentioned above installations were designated as a function of inlet gas turbine temperature and air compressor pressure ratio for assumed oxygen recovery rate in high temperature membrane. With the knowledge of these quantities, a net efficiency of the power plant for two oxygen recovery rates were determined. Due to this efficiency the optimal air compression ratios were determined.;2013;0;0;
"Engaging the community with a ""Green Town"" concept";"This paper describes a novel CO2 mitigation concept named ""Green Town"". ""Green Town"" is a fully integrated carbon capture and storage (CCS) system applied at a town or city scale. It utilises air capture techniques to capture CO2 directly from atmosphere, as opposed to other CCS systems where CO2 is typically captured in flue gas streams pre- or post-combustion, then the captured CO2 is transported by pipeline and sequestered in offshore deep geological formations. The entire system is meant to be built within a community and in this way to inspire and interest the public and the younger generation regarding CCS technology. With enhanced public understanding of CO2 mitigation via CCS techniques it is therefore possible to engage the public in the early stage of CCS implementation. Technical details of the ""Green Town"" concept are given. To evaluate public acceptance of the ""Green Town"" concept, questionnaire surveys were designed and carried in Southampton, UK and Hamburg, Germany in August 2011. Total of 158 and 366 effective completed questionnaires were collected from these two cities respectively. Results from both surveys are presented. It is shown that generally there was a direct correlation between positive perception of CCS and positive perception of the ""Green Town"" idea. There was a stronger preference for the ""Green Town"" concept than for conventional CCS. This provides evidence that the idea of engaging the public through the ""Green Town"" concept could play an important role in laying a strong foundation for public interest in CCS projects. To explore the diversity of opinions on the ""Green Town"" idea and CCS between the two surveyed cities, a comparison of results from Southampton and Hamburg is also presented. The proposed ""Green Town"" concept of air capture in the community was shown to be a viably possible route for public engagement in this or other CCS projects.";2013;1;1;green town
A moisture swing sorbent for direct air capture of carbon dioxide: Thermodynamic and kinetic analysis;An amine-based anion exchange resin was utilized to capture CO2 from ambient air. The sorbent is able to absorb CO2 when it is dry and release CO2 when exposed to liquid water or water vapor. The absorption isotherm test shows that the sorbent behaves efficiently even at very low CO2 concentration. Its capacity in carbonate form is 0.86 mol of CO2 per kilogram under 25 °C and 40 Pa. Langmuir model describes well the absorption isotherm at high saturation. The kinetics of CO2 desorption dispersed in a flat sheet of polypropylene has been studied by experiments and models. We accounted for boundary layer transport limitations and made boundary layers thin enough to avoid such changes. The kinetic parameters of desorption, desorption coefficient and activation energy, are determined.;2013;1;0;
Influence of oxygen recovery rate in air separation unit with ionic separation membrane on economic effectiveness of oxy-type power plant;The supercritical power plant analyzed in this paper, contains the following elements: steam turbine, hard coal-fired oxy-type pulverized fuel boiler, carbon dioxide capture unit and air separation unit with four-end type high-temperature separation membrane. The power of the steam turbine generator is equal to 600 MW. This steam turbine is fed with the live steam with thermodynamic parameters 650 °C/30 MPa and reheated steam with parameters 670 °C/6 MPa. For the assumed electric power of the steam turbine generator the net efficiency of the power plant, investment cost of the entire power plant and its components as a function of the oxygen recovery rate were determined Then, among others, a fixed and variable costs of electricity generation in each year of the power plant work were determined. This allowed to designate the break-even price of electricity under assumption that the net present value (NPV) is equal to zero. The economic effectiveness of the analyzed oxy-type power plant was compared with a classic power plant equipped with pulverized fuel boiler, in which hard coal is burned in the air.;2013;0;0;
Moisture-swing sorption for carbon dioxide capture from ambient air: a thermodynamic analysis;An ideal chemical sorbent for carbon dioxide capture from ambient air (air capture) must have a number of favourable properties, such as environmentally benign behaviour, a high affinity for CO2 at very low concentration (400 ppm), and a low energy cost for regeneration. The last two properties seem contradictory, especially for sorbents employing thermal swing adsorption. On the other hand, thermodynamic analysis shows that the energy cost of an air capture device need only be slightly larger than that of a flue gas scrubber. The moisture swing separation process studied in this paper provides a novel approach to low cost CO2 capture from air. The anionic exchange resin sorbent binds CO2 when dry and releases it when wet. A thermodynamic model with coupled phase and chemical equilibria is developed to study the complex H2O-CO2-resin system. The moisture swing behaviour is compatible with hydration energies changing with the activity of water on the resin surfaces. This activity is in turn set by the humidity. The rearrangement of hydration water on the resin upon the sorption of a CO2 molecule is predicted as a function of the humidity and temperature. Using water as fuel to drive the moisture swing enables an economical, large-scale implementation of air capture. By generating CO2 with low partial pressures, the present technology has implications for in situ CO2 utilizations which require low pressure CO2 gas rather than liquid CO2.;2013;1;0;
Reversible CO2 capture with porous polymers using the humidity swing;Several polymeric materials were prepared for reversible CO2 capture. These materials contain quaternary ammonium ions and hydroxide counter ions, including polymers grafted from carbon black, crosslinked porous polymers templated by ordered colloidal crystals, and high internal phase emulsion systems. The porous polymers displayed an order of magnitude improvement in the kinetics of the absorption and desorption processes and a significant improvement in the swing sizes compared to a commercially available material with similar functional groups. This work suggests a new direction for the design of porous polymeric materials for CO2 air capture.;2013;1;0;
Response surface methodology as an efficient tool for optimizing carbon adsorbents for CO2 capture;Phenol-formaldehyde resins and a low-cost biomass residue, olive stones (OS), were used to prepare five activated carbons for CO2 separation at atmospheric pressure, i.e., in post-combustion processes or from biogas and bio-hydrogen streams. Two phenol-formaldehyde resins were synthesized: Resol, obtained by using alkaline environment, and Novolac, synthesized in the presence of an acid catalyst. Carbon precursors were prepared by mixing both resins with KCl or by mixing the Novolac resin with OS. The precursors were carbonized under an inert atmosphere of N-2 at different temperatures. The last stage in the synthesis of the adsorbents involved physical activation with carbon dioxide, which was carried out at different temperatures and burn-off degrees. Response surface methodology (RSM) is proposed as a tool for rapidly optimizing the activation parameters in order to obtain the highest possible CO2 capture capacity of activated carbons. The optimum values of activation temperature and burn-off degree that maximize CO2 uptake by the activated carbons at 35 degrees C and atmospheric pressure were obtained within the experimental region. A value of CO2 adsorption capacity of 9.3 wt.% was achieved. Activated carbons derived from the Novolac phenol-formaldehyde resin type and from OS showed great potential as adsorbents for CO2 capture at atmospheric pressure. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Hybrid preconcentrator/focuser module for determinations of explosivemarker compounds with a micro-scale gas chromatograph;This article describes the development and characterization of a partially selective preconcentrator/focuser (PCF) module for a field-portable micro-scale gas chromatograph (mu GC) designed to rapidly determine trace levels of two vapor-phase markers of the explosive trinitrotoluene (TNT): 2,3-dimethy1-2,3-dinitrobutane (DMNB) and 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT). The PCF module has three primary components. The first is a high-volume sampler, comprising a resistively-heated 6-cm long stainless steel tube packed with tandem beds of the graphitized carbons Carbopack B (C-B, 30 mg) and Carbopack Y (C-Y, 15 mg), which traps the markers but permits more volatile interferences to pass through largely unretained. The second component is a microfocuser (mu F), comprising a 4.2 x 9.8 mm Si chip containing a deep-reactive-ion-etched (DRIE) cavity packed with 2 mg of C-B, a Pyrex cap, integrated heaters, and etched fluidic channels. The third component is a commercial polymer-membrane filter used as a pre-trap to remove particles and adsorbed low volatility interferences. Markers captured in the sampler are thermally desorbed and transferred to the mu F, and then thermally desorbed/injected from the mu F into a downstream separation (micro)column and detected. Scrubbed ambient air is used as carrier gas. The adsorbent capacities, baseline temperatures, sampling and desorption flow rates, and heating profiles were optimized for each PCF module component while minimizing the analysis time. An overall transfer efficiency of 86% was achieved at marker concentrations of similar to 0.2-2.6 ppb. In the final configuration the PCF module requires just 60 s to collect a 1-L sample (3 L/min), focus (40 mL/min), and inject the markers (3 mL/min), producing half-maximum injection peak widths of similar to 2 and 5 s, and preconcentration factors of 4500 and 1800, for DMNB and 2,4-DNT, respectively.

Importance of Ambient O-2 for Electrochemical Enrichment of Atmospheric CO2;Enrichment is a prerequisite for CO2 reduction from air and demands mild conditions for energy saving. Electrochemically generated OH- and H+ can be employed for atmosphere CO2 enrichment (capture and recovery) under ambient condition. This study demonstrated the importance of the coexisting ambient O-2 in the electrochemical OH-/H+ generation. Our system showed that CO2 in air could be captured simultaneously with the OH-/H+ generation. Meanwhile, O-2 in air served to start up such generation from a cell voltage of 1.3 V, significantly lower than 2.2 V without O-2. Simple modeling and experiments of OH-/H+ generation evidenced that ambient O-2 elevated the effectiveness of OH-/H+ generation by lifting the energy efficiency in a galvanostatic mode, and accelerating the generation rate in a potentiostatic mode. Meanwhile, the effectiveness elevation was attributed to an improvement of the intrinsic properties of electrode reactions for OH-/H+ generation. Rather, beyond the cell voltage of 4.9 V, no difference was observed in the effectiveness regardless of the presence of ambient O-2. This study would be helpful for designing an effective electrochemical process of atmospheric CO2 enrichment by utilizing ambient O-2 that undergoes an electrode process without consumption.;2013;1;1;
Carbon sequestration potential of post-mining reforestation activities on the KwaZulu-Natal coast, South Africa;"Restoration of former mined land can potentially capture large quantities of atmospheric carbon dioxide if appropriate reclamation techniques and post-reclamation management strategies are applied. The objectives of the current study were: to quantify carbon stocks in five pools; to develop empirical relationships between stand age and carbon stocks; to compare the carbon sequestration potential of rehabilitated land under different land uses and to recommend management practices to maximize carbon sequestration. The carbon stocks in five pools (aboveground, belowground, litter, debris and soil), of the rehabilitated vegetation were quantified. For this purpose, 18 sites were selected including both commercial plantations and rehabilitated indigenous forests. The relationship between total, aboveground and belowground carbon stocks in the Casuarina equisetifolia plantation and stand age was sigmoidal, whereas the relationship was linear for the rehabilitating indigenous forest. The rehabilitated indigenous forest exceeded the mean net carbon storage of C. equisetifolia plantations after 19 years. Maximum carbon accumulation in the rehabilitated indigenous forest compared well with values reported for reclaimed ecosystems in the USA and Europe. Carbon sequestration potential of the mined land could be optimized and natural capital restored through reforestation of harvested C. equisetifolia plantations with indigenous forest.";2013;0;0;
The thermodynamics of direct air capture of carbon dioxide;An analysis of thermodynamic constraints shows that the low concentration of carbon dioxide in ambient air does not pose stringent limits on air capture economics. The thermodynamic energy requirement is small even using an irreversible sorbent-based process. A comparison to flue gas scrubbing suggests that the additional energy requirement is small and can be supplied with low-cost energy. In general, the free energy expended in the regeneration of a sorbent will exceed the free energy of mixing, as absorption is usually not reversible. The irreversibility, which grows with the depth of scrubbing, tends to affect flue gas scrubbing more than air capture which can successfully operate while extracting only a small fraction of the carbon dioxide available in air. This is reflected in a significantly lower theoretical thermodynamic efficiency for a single stage flue gas scrubber than for an air capture device, but low carbon dioxide concentration in air still results in a larger energy demand for air capture. The energy required for capturing carbon dioxide from air could be delivered in various ways. I analyze a thermal swing and also a previously described moisture swing which is driven by the evaporation of water. While the total amount of heat supplied for sorbent regeneration in a thermal swing, in accordance with Carnot's principle, exceeds the total free energy requirement, the additional free energy required as one moves from flue gas scrubbing to air capture can be paid with an amount of additional low grade heat that equals the additional free energy requirement. Carnot's principle remains satisfied because the entire heat supplied, not just the additional amount, must be delivered at a slightly higher temperature. Whether the system is driven by water evaporation or by low grade heat, the cost of the thermodynamically-required energy can be as small as $1 to $2 per metric ton of carbon dioxide. Thermodynamics does not pose a practical constraint on the implementation of air capture but leaves quite some leeway for unavoidable inefficiencies in practical systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Shape- and Morphology-Controlled Sustainable Synthesis of Cu, Co, and In Metal Organic Frameworks with High CO2 Capture Capacity;We studied the effects of various surfactants on the shape and morphology of three metal organic frameworks (MOFs), i.e., Co-MOF, Cu-MOF, and In-MOF, which were synthesized under microwave irradiation. The as-synthesized materials were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and nitrogen sorption. The effects of microwave irradiation time, temperature, and surfactant template were investigated. The synthetic parameters, including the type of surfactant template and the reaction temperature, played crucial roles in the size, shape, and morphology of the MOF microcrystals. We also evaluated these MOFs as sorbents for capturing CO2. Of the synthesized materials, Cu-MOF demonstrated the highest CO2 capture capacity, even at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature.;2013;1;0;
Direct air capture of CO2 and climate stabilization: A model based assessment;"This paper provides a novel assessment of the role of direct air capture of CO2 from ambient air (DAC) on the feasibility of achieving stringent climate stabilization. We use the WITCH energy-economy-climate model to investigate the long term prospects of DAC, implementing a technological specification based on recent estimates by the American Physical Society (APS 2011). Assuming global cooperation on a stringent climate policy we find that: (1) DAC is deployed only late in century, after other low carbon options, though at a very significant scale; (2) DAC has an impact on the marginal and total abatement costs (reducing them) and on the timing of mitigation (postponing it); (3) DAC also allows for a prolonged use of oil, with a positive welfare impact for energy exporting countries. Finally, we assess the role of DAC in a less than ideal climate policy by exploring its potential for engaging energy exporting countries in climate mitigation activities by means of a ""clean oil"" market in which oil exporters can sell oil decarbonized via DAC.";2013;1;1;
Direct air capture of CO2 with chemicals: optimization of a two-loop hydroxide carbonate system using a countercurrent air-liquid contactor;"Direct Air Capture (DAC) of CO2 with chemicals, recently assessed in a dedicated study by the American Physical Society (APS), is further investigated with the aim of optimizing the design of the front-end section of its benchmark two-loop hydroxide-carbonate system. Two new correlations are developed that relate mass transfer and pressure drop to the air and liquid flow velocities in the countercurrent packed absorption column. These relationships enable an optimization to be performed over the parameters of the air contactor, specifically the velocities of air and liquid sorbent and the fraction of CO2 captured. Three structured Sulzer packings are considered: Mellapak-250Y, Mellapak-500Y, and Mellapak-CC. These differ in cost and pressure drop per unit length; Mellapak-CC is new and specifically designed for CO2 capture. Scaling laws are developed to estimate the costs of the alternative DAC systems relative to the APS benchmark, for plants capturing 1 Mt of CO2 per year from ambient air at 500 ppm CO2 concentration. The optimized avoided cost hardly differs across the three packing materials, ranging from $518/tCO(2) for M-CC to $568/tCO(2) for M-250Y. The $610/tCO(2) avoided cost for the APS-DAC design used M-250 Y but was not optimized; thus, optimization with the same packing lowered the avoided cost of the APS system by 7 % and improved packing lowered the avoided cost by a further 9 % The overall optimization exercise confirms that capture from air with the APS benchmark system or systems with comparable avoided costs is not a competitive mitigation strategy as long as the energy system contains high-carbon power, since implementation of Carbon Capture and Storage, substitution with low-carbon power and end-use efficiency will offer lower avoided-cost strategies.";2013;1;1;
Carbon Dioxide Capture from Air Using Amine-Grafted Porous Polymer Networks;Amine-grafted porous polymer networks were investigated for CO2 capture directly from air (400 ppm CO2, 78.96% N-2, and 21% O-2). Under these ultradilute conditions, PPN-6-CH(2)DETA has an extraordinarily high CO2 selectivity (3.6 x 10(10)) and loading capacity (1.04 mol/kg) as calculated using ideal adsorption solution theory. In addition we have shown that the material outperforms other materials based on simulated breakthrough calculations, thus showing great potential to be used in direct air capture applications.;2013;1;0;
Oxidative Stability of Amino Polymer-Alumina Hybrid Adsorbents for Carbon Dioxide Capture;Amine/oxide hybrid carbon dioxide adsorbents prepared via impregnation of low molecular weight polymeric amines into porous oxide supports are among the most promising solid adsorbents developed for postcombustion CO2 capture or CO2 extraction from ambient air. The oxidative stability of adsorbents prepared by impregnation of poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) or poly(allylamine) (PAA) into mesoporous gamma-alumina under humid oxidation conditions is evaluated in this work. The PEI-based adsorbents, which contain primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, are shown to degrade drastically at elevated temperatures (110 degrees C) and in high oxygen concentrations (21%, akin to air), with these effects reduced by both reductions in temperature (70 degrees C) and oxygen concentration (5%, akin to flue gas). The oxidation behavior of PEI-based adsorbents supported on alumina is qualitatively similar to past work on silica-supported PEI adsorbents. In contrast, the alumina-supported PAA adsorbents that contain only primary amines show significantly improved oxidative stability, losing only 10% or less of their original CO2 capacity after prolonged oxidative treatment under a variety of conditions. Analysis of the fresh and thermally treated samples by Fourier transform (FT) IR, FT-Raman, and C-13 NMR spectroscopies demonstrates the clear formation of carbonyl functionalities over the oxidized PEI-based adsorbents, whereas no significant changes in the spectra for PAA samples are observed after oxidative treatments. The collected data demonstrate that secondary-amine-free, primary-amine-rich polymers such as PAA may be used to formulate supported amine adsorbents with improved oxidative stability compared to adsorbents based on PEI, which is used ubiquitously in the field today.;2013;1;0;
Capturing atmospheric CO2 using supported amine sorbents for microalgae cultivation;In this work, we propose, demonstrate and evaluate the concept of atmospheric CO2 capture for enhanced algae cultivation (and horticulture), as alternative to the application of flue gas derived CO2. A supported amine sorbent was prepared and able to capture CO2 at atmospheric conditions and releasing it at higher pressures and purity. Adsorption capacities were determined for CO2 concentrations from phi(CO2) = 0.0200% to phi(CO2) = 10% and temperatures up to 55 degrees C. Regeneration was done by thermal swing. At high temperatures (above 100 degrees C) high purity CO2 can be produced at elevated pressure. However, this is not required for algae cultivation and regeneration at lower purity (e.g. phi(CO2) = 2%) allows for lowering the regeneration temperature down to 70-80 degrees C, enabling the use of low grade heat. Under these conditions the sorbent is still able to realize cyclic capacities for CO2 of around 2 mol kg(-1) sorbent. In cultivation experiments the effect of CO2 dosing on the growth rate of Desmodesmus sp. was investigated, showing an optimum at phi(CO2) = 1.5%. Experiments were carried out adsorbing CO2 from air, producing a CO2 enriched gas and use this in the cultivation of Desmodesmus sp., thereby successfully demonstrating the concept. Finally, the concept is compared with CO2 dosing using fossil fuel derived flue gas. Energy costs are comparable and additional benefits, as flexibility with respect to location and scale, avoiding impurities and, above all, closing the carbon cycle makes atmospheric CO2 capture a competitive, sustainable option for Algae Biorefineries.

Direct electrolytic dissolution of silicate minerals for air CO2 mitigation and carbon-negative H-2 production;We experimentally demonstrate the direct coupling of silicate mineral dissolution with saline water electrolysis and H-2 production to effect significant air CO2 absorption, chemical conversion, and storage in solution. In particular, we observed as much as a 10(5)-fold increase in OH-concentration (pH increase of up to 5.3 units) relative to experimental controls following the electrolysis of 0.25 M Na2SO4 solutions when the anode was encased in powdered silicate mineral, either wollastonite or an ultramafic mineral. After electrolysis, full equilibration of the alkalized solution with air led to a significant pH reduction and as much as a 45-fold increase in dissolved inorganic carbon concentration. This demonstrated significant spontaneous air CO2 capture, chemical conversion, and storage as a bicarbonate, predominantly as NaHCO3. The excess OH-initially formed in these experiments apparently resulted via neutralization of the anolyte acid, H2SO4, by reaction with the base mineral silicate at the anode, producing mineral sulfate and silica. This allowed the NaOH, normally generated at the cathode, to go unneutralized and to accumulate in the bulk electrolyte, ultimately reacting with atmospheric CO2 to form dissolved bicarbonate. Using nongrid or nonpeak renewable electricity, optimized systems at large scale might allow relatively high-capacity, energy-efficient (<300 kJ/mol of CO2 captured), and inexpensive (<$100 per tonne of CO2 mitigated) removal of excess air CO2 with production of carbon-negative H-2. Furthermore, when added to the ocean, the produced hydroxide and/or (bi) carbonate could be useful in reducing sea-to-air CO2 emissions and in neutralizing or offsetting the effects of ongoing ocean acidification.;2013;1;1;
Co-Location of Air Capture, Subseafloor CO2 Sequestration, and Energy Production on the Kerguelen Plateau;Reducing atmospheric CO2 using a combination of air capture and offshore geological storage can address technical and policy concerns with climate mitigation. Because CO2 mixes rapidly in the atmosphere, air capture could operate anywhere and in principle reduce CO2 to preindustrial levels. We investigate the Kerguelen plateau in the Indian Ocean, which offers steady wind resources, vast subseafloor storage capacities, and minimal risk of economic damages or human inconvenience and harm. The efficiency of humidity swing driven air capture under humid and windy conditions is tested in the laboratory. Powered by wind, we estimate similar to 75 Mt CO2/yr could be collected using air capture and sequestered below seafloor or partially used for synfuel. Our analysis suggests that Kerguelen offers a remote and environmentally secure location for CO2 sequestration using renewable energy.

Polyethylenimine-Impregnated Resin for High CO2 Adsorption: An Efficient Adsorbent for CO2 Capture from Simulated Flue Gas and Ambient Air;Polyethylenimine (PEI)-impregnated resins with high CO2 adsorption capacity were successfully prepared loading to achieve high CO2 adsorption, and the optimal PEI in this study. The nonpolar resin HP20 was suitable for PEI loading was 50 wt %. On the basis of the pore size distribution of the resin before and after PEI modification, it can be found that mesopores of <43 nm were mainly responsible for PEI loading and pores in the range of 43-68 nm were probably favorable for CO2 diffusion. The adsorbed amount of CO2 on HP20/PEI-50 decreased with increasing adsorption temperature because of the dominant role of exothermic reaction of CO2 adsorption. The adsorption of CO2 on the adsorbent was very fast, and sorption equilibrium was achieved within 6 min at 75 degrees C. HP20/PEI-50 almost kept a stable adsorption capacity for CO2 at concentrations of 15 vol % and 400 ppm in the consecutive adsorption-desorption cycles, and its adsorption capacity was 181 mg/g from pure CO2 and 99.3 mg/g from 400 ppm CO2 at 25 degrees C, higher than all PEI-modified materials reported. The high volume-based amount of CO2 adsorbed on HP20/PEI-50 (96.0 mg/cm(3) at 25 degrees C and 84.5 mg/cm(3) at 75 degrees C for pure CO2) is beneficial to reducing the required volume of the adsorption bed for CO2 capture. This spherical and stable HP20/PEI-50 adsorbent with high and fast CO2 adsorption exhibits a very promising application in CO2 capture from flue gas and ambient air.;2013;1;0;
Coupling Mineral Carbonation and Ocean Liming;"The process by which basic/ultrabasic silicate minerals (e.g., olivine) are reacted with CO2 to produce solid carbonate minerals (""mineral carbonation"") has been suggested as a method to sequester carbon dioxide from point sources into stable carbonate minerals. Alternatively, the addition of lime (produced from calcining carbonate minerals) to the surface ocean (""ocean liming""), which results in an increase in ocean pH and a draw-down of atmospheric CO2 has been proposed as a ""geoengineering"" technology, which stores carbon as dissolved alkalinity in the surface ocean. Combining these approaches, in which the magnesium carbonate minerals produced from mineral carbonation are used as a feedstock for ocean liming (mineral carbonation-ocean liming; MC-OL); may reduce the limitations of individual technologies while maximizing the benefits. Approximately 1.9 metric tons of magnesium silicate (producing 0.7 ton of magnesium oxide) are required for every net ton of CO2 sequestered. A total of 0.7 ton of CO2 is produced from this activity, 70% of which is high-purity (>98%) from calcining and potentially amenable for geological storage. The technology can be conceptually viewed as an alternative to direct air capture and swaps ambient CO2 for high-purity point source CO2. MC-OL requires approximately 4.9 and 2.2 GJ of thermal and electrical energy ton(-1) of CO2 sequestered. MC-OL has less demand for geological storage; only 0.5 ton of CO2 needs to be injected for every ton of CO2 removed from the atmosphere. However, manipulation of ocean chemistry in this way potentially creates an additional environmental impact (localized elevated pH or co-dissolution of trace metals) and requires attention.";2013;0;0;

Direct CO2 capture from ambient air using K2CO3/Al2O3 composite sorbent;A composite sorbent K2CO3/gamma-Al2O3 was synthesized and tested for direct carbon dioxide capture from ambient air. Composition and structure of the composite were characterized by means of atomic absorption spectroscopy, low-temperature nitrogen adsorption, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry methods. CO2 absorption from air and desorption experiments were performed in a continuous-flow system. The effect of temperature on thermal regeneration of the composite was investigated. It was shown that stable CO2 absorption capacity of 4.0-4.9 wt.% can be obtained in cycles with regeneration temperature of 250-300 degrees C The composite sorbent demonstrated a great stability of its CO2 absorption characteristics, therefore it should be considered as a promising material for direct carbon dioxide capture from air. The total energy required for air-borne CO2 capture and its subsequent methanation was assessed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2013;1;0;
Moisture-resistant porous polymer from concentrated emulsion as low-cost and high-capacity sorbent for CO2 capture;A moisture-resistant CO2 adsorbent was designed and prepared. The adsorbent used porous polystyrene as a skeleton, surface modified with amine groups. The structure and morphology of the adsorbent were characterized using infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive spectrometry. Due to the huge specific surface area covered by a large number of amine groups, such porous material could be applied for capturing carbon dioxide under atmospheric pressure. Under a pressure of 100 Kpa, 3.46 mmol g(-1) of CO2 adsorption uptake was observed. The porous adsorbent also exhibited a high CO2 adsorption rate, excellent moisture resistance, good selectivity for CO2-N-2 separation, and easy CO2 regeneration.;2013;1;0;

CO2-Responsive Polymers;"This Review focuses on the recent progress in the area of CO2-responsive polymers and provides detailed descriptions of these existing examples. CO2-responsive polymers can be categorized into three types based on their CO2 responsive groups: amidine, amine, and carboxyl groups. Compared with traditional temperature, pH, or light stimuli-responsive polymers, CO2 responsive polymers provide the advantage to use CO2 as a ""green"" trigger as well as to capture CO2 directly from air. In addition, the current challenges of CO2-responsive polymers are discussed and the different solution methods are compared. Noteworthy, CO2-responsive polymers are considered to have a prosperous future in various scientific areas.";2013;1;0;X overview on materials
Three-Dimensionally Ordered Macroporous Polymeric Materials by Colloidal Crystal Templating for Reversible CO2 Capture;The design and preparation of porous materials with controlled structures and functionalities is crucial to a variety of absorption- or separation-relevant applications, including CO2 capture. Here, novel functional polymeric materials with three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) structures are prepared by using colloidal crystals as templates using relatively simple, rapid, and inexpensive approaches. These ordered structures are used for the reversible CO2 capture from ambient air by humidity swing. Typically, the colloidal crystal template is synthesized from polymer latex particles of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) or polystyrene (PS). To maintain the functionality of the material, it is important to prevent the porous structure collapsing, which can occur by the hydrolysis of the ester bonds in conventional crosslinkers under basic conditions. This hydrolysis can be prevented by using a water-soluble crosslinker containing two quaternary ammonium moieties, which can be used to prepare stable porous crosslinked polymers with the monomer (vinylbenzyl)trimethylammonium chloride (VBTMACl) and using a PMMA-based colloidal crystal template. The hydroxide-containing monomer and dicationic crosslinker are synthesized from their chloride precursors, avoiding the ion-exchange step which causes shrinkage of the pores. An analysis of different methods for infiltrating the monomer solution into the colloidal crystal template shows that infiltration using capillary forces leads to fewer defects than infiltration under a partial vacuum. In addition, functional macroporous films with micrometer thickness are prepared from a template of PS-based colloidal crystals in a thin film. In general, the colloidal crystal templated materials showed improved CO2 absorption/desorption rates and swing sizes compared to a commercially available material with similar functional groups. This work could easily be extended to create a new generation of ordered macroporous polymeric materials with tunable functionalities for other applications.;2013;1;0;
Stability of Amine-Functionalized Cellulose during Temperature-Vacuum-Swing Cycling for CO2 Capture from Air;The stability of amine-functionalized nanofibrilated cellulose sorbent for direct air capture of CO2 is investigated during temperature-vacuum-swing (TVS) cycling. The presence of 02 at 90 degrees C degrades the sorbent, reducing its CO2 adsorption capacity by 30% after 15 h of treatment in moist air with a dew point of 22 degrees C. In contrast, exposure to moist CO2 at 90 degrees C with a dew point of 22 degrees C does not deteriorate its CO2 adsorption capacity after 15 h. Performing 100 TVS consecutive cycles, with CO2 adsorption from ambient air containing 400-530 ppm CO2 at 30 degrees C and 60% relative humidity and with CO2 desorption at 90 degrees C and 30 mbar, resulted in a reduction of the equilibrium CO2 adsorption capacity by maximum 5%. The average CO2 adsorption capacity during TVS cyclic operation is 0.90 mmol CO2/g.;2013;1;0;
Comparison of CO2 capture economics for iron and steel mills;One of the largest energy consuming manufacturing industries in the world is the iron and steel industry which emits almost 5% of the total world CO2 emissions. Previous studies examining the application of CO2 capture at iron and steel mills evaluated capture at conventional and Corex iron and steel mills. This study extends the analysis to include Hismelt, Midrex and the mini mill. In the first part of our study, we present a high level scoping assessment of the opportunities for implementing CO2 capture at existing direct atmospheric CO2 emission points. Implementing CO2 capture using commercial MEA solvent at a conventional iron and steel mill costs from A$ 80 to A$ 250 per tonne of CO2 avoided. Estimated costs to capture from the existing point sources at the Hismelt and Corex iron and steel mills also range from A$ 80 to A$ 250 per tonne of CO2 avoided. At a direct reduction iron process such as Midrex, the cost of CO2 capture from the process stack gas is estimated at about A$ 90 per tonne of CO2 avoided. A cost of approximately A$ 110 to A$ 130 per tonne of CO2 avoided is estimated to capture from the EAF unit of the steel production route for the Midrex and mini mill processes.Alternatively, CO2 can also be captured where it is produced from processes such as the blast furnace or reduction vessel. Although these streams contain a high level of CO2, they are used as a low-grade fuel throughout the plant and the produced CO2 is vented elsewhere. This study also estimates the cost of capturing the CO2 before further combustion and venting. The costs are estimated for the conventional iron and steel mill blast furnace, the top gas recycling blast furnace (TGRBF), Hismelt and Corex reduction vessel gases. Capture using MEA solvent absorption, the costs range from A$ 65 to almost A$ 80 per tonne CO2 avoided. Using Vacuum Pressure Swing Adsorption technology in place of MEA solvent absorption, the capture costs for these gases reduce by approximately 25-40%. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Adsorptive drying of CO2 using low grade heat and humid, ambient air;Adsorptive separation of water from CO2 is an appealing alternative to liquid absorbers for post-combustion capture systems. In all cases, the purified CO2 stream from a PCC system will have a high moisture content and, due to equipment corrosion issues and the risk of hydrate formation, the CO2 stream must be rigorously dried prior to being compressed. This work reports the first study on solid adsorbent selection for CO2 drying using low grade heat and ambient air as a regeneration gas. Different types of adsorbents, chosen for their range of water adsorption characteristics, have been investigated for the desiccation of a pure CO2 stream. When destined for sequestration the CO2 product gas has little value and so the drying process should require no supporting process operations and should consume little additional energy. However, due to the costs and complexity of separating and purifying CO2 from a flue gas stream, the drying process should return as much CO2 as possible to the compression stage. An ideal desiccant for CO2 drying should have a high moisture capacity and selectivity and should be regenerable using waste heat and ambient, humid air. The CO2 drying performance of Na-, Ca-, and Ca/H- forms of ETS-10 were compared to that of commercial silica and 4A zeolite. Ca-ETS-10 was found to have the highest moisture capacity using a temperature swing of 30-70 degrees C and a CO2 feed stream of 50-100% relative humidity. Due to the intrinsic selectivity for water over CO2 on solid adsorbents, all desiccants tested had a CO2 recovery greater than 95%. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2013;1;0;
Fighting global warming by photocatalytic reduction of CO2 using giant photocatalytic reactors;"Over the last decades, fighting global warming has become the most important challenge humanity has to face. Therefore technologies of carbon dioxide capture, sequestration and recycling are equally important in order to tackle the global climate change stakes. Among recycling technologies, photocatalytic processes reducing CO2 with H2O back to fuels or to other useful organic compounds, have the potential to be part of a renewable energy system. Indeed these processes can help to control CO2 emissions and eventually eliminate CO2 in excess.This perspective paper describes a large size device, able simultaneously:to proceed to direct air capture (DAC) of CO2;to transform part of it into useful chemicals, like hydrocarbons or syngas;and to produce renewable energy, thus preventing future CO2 emissions.Synergies between solar chimney power plants (SCPPs) and semiconductor photocatalysis in order to create giant photocatalytic reactors for artificial photosynthesis are discussed, as well as scale economies for unconventional carbon capture directly from the atmosphere.This paper presents a carbon negative emission technology obtained by coupling SCPPs with DAC systems which allows many scale economies, and also synergies to proceed to solar-to-chemical energy-conversion process by photocatalytic reduction of atmospheric CO2 under sunlight.

The use of solar energy can enhance the conversion of carbon dioxide into energy-rich products: stepping towards artificial photosynthesis;"The need to cut CO2 emission into the atmosphere is pushing scientists and technologists to discover and implement new strategies that may be effective for controlling the CO2 atmospheric level (and its possible effects on climate change). One option is the capture of CO2 from power plant flue gases or other industrial processes to avoid it entering the atmosphere. The captured CO2 can be either disposed in natural fields (geological cavities, spent gas or oil wells, coal beads, aquifers; even oceans have been proposed) or used as a source of carbon in synthetic processes. In this paper, we present the options for CO2 utilization and make an analysis of possible solutions for the conversion of large volumes of CO2 by either combining it with H-2, that must be generated from water, or by directly converting it into fuels by electrolysis in water using solar energy. A CO2-H-2-based economy may address the issue of reducing the environmental burden of energy production, also saving fossil carbon for future generations. The integration of CO2 capture and utilization with CO2 capture and storage would result in a more economically and energetically viable practice of CO2 capture.";2013;1;1;
UK carbon capture and storage, where is it?;Carbon capture and storage, to capture CO2 from power plants and big industry, remains much publicised, much talked about as an essential action against climate change, and intensively analysed and costed. However only four governments have had the courage to provide actual or allocated commercial funding to enable the first integrated projects to occur. The UK has experimented with several proposed funding mechanisms, and with several proposed designs for full-scale projects. However perceived expense remains a persistent blockage from the government perspective. And from the company perspective, perceived risk remains the critical disincentive. The UK has abundant storage which is ready to develop. CCS on gas (or maybe coal) fuelled plant is seen as the ideal compliment to variable wind power, and so is critical to the UK's future electricity delivery planning. What many analysts miss is that CO 2 storage will also be vital to any negative emissions strategy - either co-firing with biomass, or direct capture form the air - both need to bury CO2. How will CO2 storage be validated for commercial use? And how will commercial markets innovate and fund the integrated and expensive projects if UK Government refuses to take on risk?;2012;0;0;

Mitigating climate change by CO2 air capture and geological storage: Opportunities for Iran;This paper investigates the preliminary strategies and tools for the implementation of CO2 air capture and geological storage as a potential mitigation option in the future climate policy of Iran. It is a method to capture CO2 directly from air and store it in geological structures based on large-scale industrial processes to enable the near-permanent sequestration of carbon. The reason for selecting this approach originates from its capability to mitigate CO2 from all economic sectors with a single technology, while the conventional capture methods are designed only for mitigation of CO2 from point sources of the power generation and industrial sectors. In order to facilitate the workflow of air capture as efficiently as possible, this study suggests some tools and directions for the selection of potential sectors and the prospective areas for the final site selection of the air capture units. © 2012 WIT Press.;2012;0;0;
Fuel from;Air Fuel Synthesis is jointly working with the universities of Nottingham and Loughborough, UK, to develop a technology for extracting and storing hydrogen from air. The company has announced that it has built a plant capable of synthesizing liquid fuels, using only air and electricity. The trial plant has proved carbon and hydrogen captured from air as a viable proposition and has processed its first fuel. The process starts with an air capture tower, which is a conventional wet scrubbing column with a forced air input manufactured by Parsons Engineering. The tower maintains a mist of sodium hydroxide at about 100°C under slight pressure, which reacts with carbon dioxide in the air, forming sodium carbonate. The resulting solution from the process is converted in a three-cell Electrocell electrolyzer to recover the CO2, which bubbles out and is stored in tanks.;2012;1;1;
Fuel synthesis with CO2 captured from atmosphere: Thermodynamic analysis;Synthetic hydrocarbon fuel, derived from renewable energy and captured carbon dioxide from flue gas and/or ambient air, can close its carbon cycle and is an important approach to sustainable energy. In this study, the thermodynamic performance of a coelectrolysis process for producing hydrogen and carbon monoxide from water and captured CO2 is investigated, based on current carbon capture and high-temperature electrolysis technologies. The exergy analysis is useful because it can reveal the energy losses due to irreversibilities and indicate possibilities for improvement of a process. Fuel synthesis systems integrated with or separated from different carbon capture technologies were evaluated and the analysis results have indicated that compared to the energy/exergy consumed by electrolysis, the energy/exergy penalty from CO2 capture is insignificant. The thermodynamic efficiency of fuel synthesis could be increased by developing fuel generation technologies with lower electricity requirements, especially when using solar and nuclear energy. ©The Electrochemical Society.;2012;1;0;
Carbon sequestration in an uncertain world;"Carbon sequestration has been proposed as an important means for mitigating climate change, particularly in the medium and longer term. Three approaches have been proposed: biological sequestration in trees and soils; capture from the flue gases of large fossil fuel-using plants, particularly for electric power generation, followed by transport and burial; capture directly from the air, followed by burial. Although biological sequestering in soils and biomass is a natural process, and is seen as the cheapest option, the annual potential is small, and storage may reverse later in the century. Carbon capture and sequestration is probably limited to about one third of annual fossil-fuel related emissions, and will have high energy and money costs if plants are not =capture-ready'. There are no limits on air capture, but it may need more energy than the energy content of the input fuels, and in any case is a high cost approach. Sequestration can be in geological reservoirs such as disused oil and gas fields, or saline aquifers. (Many researchers rule out ocean burial, both because of its adverse environmental effects and because of the temporary nature of storage.) There is however, great uncertainty in the total safe capacity of geological reservoirs. Perhaps even more importantly, the time for absorbtion mechanisms to act varies from immediate to hundreds or even thousands of years, so that annual limits on safe disposal may be the limiting factor. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Thermodynamic analysis of a supercritical power plant with oxy type pulverized fuel boiler, carbon dioxide capture system (cc) and four-end high temperature membrane air separator;"In this paper the analysis of a supercritical power plant was made. Power of the power plant is 460 MW. The parameters of life steam are at 29 MPa/600 oC and of the reheated steam 4.8 MPa/600 oC. Power plant is equipped with the following units: oxy type pulverized fuel boiler, ""four-end"" high temperature membrane (HTM) air separator and carbon dioxide capture system (CC). With the assumption of a constant gross power of the analyzed power plant the thermal efficiency of the boiler and power consumption of all mentioned above units were calculated. These parameters were designated as a function of the recovery rate of oxygen in the HTM. This allowed to make the characteristic of efficiency as a function of recovery rate. The net efficiency increased from 34.8% to 36.7% with a change of oxygen recovery rate from 0.45 to 0.9. The effect of membrane working temperature on the efficiency characteristics was also analyzed. Integration of CC, HTM air separator and steam cycle was proposed for the increase of the efficiency of a power plant. The theoretical analysis was carried out and appropriate calculations were made for this integration.";2012;1;0;
A solid molecular basket sorbent for CO2 capture from gas streams with low CO2 concentration under ambient conditions;In this paper, a solid molecular basket sorbent, 50 wt% PEI/SBA-15, was studied for CO2 capture from gas streams with low CO2 concentration under ambient conditions. The sorbent was able to effectively and selectively capture CO2 from a gas stream containing 1% CO2 at 75 degrees C, with a breakthrough and saturation capacity of 63.1 and 66.7 mg g(-1), respectively, and a selectivity of 14 for CO2/CO and 185 for CO2/Ar. The sorption performance of the sorbent was influenced greatly by the operating temperature. The CO2-TPD study showed that the sorbent could be regenerated under mild conditions (50-110 degrees C) and was stable in the cyclic operations for at least 20 cycles. Furthermore, the possibility for CO2 capture from air using the PEI/SBA-15 sorbent was studied by FTIR and proved by TPD. A capacity of 22.5 mg g(-1) was attained at 75 degrees C via a TPD method using a simulated air with 400 ppmv CO2 in N-2.;2012;0;0;
Willingness to Pay for a Climate Backstop: Liquid Fuel Producers and Direct CO2 Air Capture;We conduct a sensitivity analysis to describe conditions under which liquid fuel producers would fund the development of a climate backstop. We estimate (1) the cost to develop competitively priced direct CO2 air capture technology, a possible climate backstop and (2) the effect of this technology on the value of liquid fuel reserves by country and fuel. Under most assumptions, development costs exceed individual benefits. A particularly robust result is that carbon prices generate large benefits for conventional oil producers making a climate backstop unappealing for them. Unilateral investment does become more likely under: stringent carbon policy, social discount rates, improved technical outcomes, and high price elasticity of demand for liquid fuels. Early stage investment is inexpensive and could provide a hedge against such developments, particularly for fuels on the margin, such as tar sands and gas-to-liquids. Since only a few entities benefit, free riding is not an important disincentive to investment, although uncertainty about who benefits probably is. doi: 10.5547/ISSN0195-6574-EJ-Vol33-No1-3;2012;1;1;
CO2-depleted warm air venting from chrysotile milling waste (Thetford Mines, Canada): Evidence for in-situ carbon capture from the atmosphere;We have discovered diffuse warm air vents at the surface of a chrysotile milling waste heap at the Black Lake mine, Thetford Mines, Quebec, Canada. The venting areas are inconspicuous, except in winter when the vents form snow-free areas of unfrozen ground, each with a surface area of 1-15 m(2). The temperature and chemical composition of the warm air vents have been monitored from March 2009 to July 2010. The temperature of the warm air and ground surface at the venting sites ranged from 6.6 to 20.0 degrees C, whereas that of the ambient air ranged from -13.2 to 20.0 degrees C. The difference between atmospheric and vent air temperatures is greater in cold-weather months. The warm air has low CO2 content, but has otherwise normal atmospheric gas composition. Warm air volumetric flow varies from 2.1 to 19.9 L/m(2)/s in winter, when it contains between <10 and 18 ppm CO2. In summer, the venting areas are more diffuse, with volumetric flow rates ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 L/m(2)/s, and are less depleted in CO2 (260-370 ppm). Frozen ground is likely focusing airflow in winter compared to summer. We present a conceptual model in which air enters the steep flanks of the chrysotile milling waste heap, into which CO2 reacts with Mg-rich minerals, stripping CO2 from air by exothermic mineral carbonation reactions. Considering the surface area of summer and winter venting areas, flow rates, and concentration of CO2 in warm air vents, we estimate that the Black Lake mine heap passively captures at least 0.6 kt CO2 per year.;2012;0;0;
Adsorption Capacity of Carbon Dioxide on Amine Modified MesoporousMaterials with Larger Pore Sizes;Mesoporous silica SBA-15-like materials with large pores were synthesized using tri-block copolymer P123 as a structure-directing agent, tetramethoxysilane as the silicon source, and different organic solvents as swelling agents. The resulting materials were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), N-2 adsorption-desorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The results showed that the introduction of swelling agents effectively enlarged the pore diameter and pore volume of the SBA-15 materials, and pore swelling with isooctane was larger than that with CCl4. When modified with tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA), all of these composite materials exhibited excellent adsorption capacities for CO2. The adsorption capacity of CO2 was independent of the pore structure, if the template was removed before modification with TEPA. By contrast, the adsorption capacity increased with the pore diameter when the as-synthesized mesoporous material was modified with TEPA. The effects of temperature and pressure on the CO2 adsorption capacity were investigated using adsorption isotherms and CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). With CO2 adsorption at higher temperature, the composite materials showed different adsorption capacities with pressure variation. As a result, the adsorption and separation of CO2 on these TEPA modified mesoporous materials in ambient air flow can be realized via pressure swing adsorption.;2012;1;0;
Capture of Carbon Dioxide from Air and Flue Gas in the Alkylamine-Appended Metal-Organic Framework mmen-Mg-2(dobpdc);"Two new metal organic frameworks, M-2(dobpdc) (M = Zn (1), Mg (2); dobpdc(4-) = 4,4'-dioxido-3,3'-biphenyldicarboxylate), adopting an expanded MOF-74 structure type, were synthesized via solvothermal and microwave methods. Coordinatively unsaturated Mg2+ cations lining the 18.4-angstrom-diameter channels of 2 were functionalized with N,N'-dimethylethylenediamine (mmen) to afford Mg-2(dobpdc)-(mmen)(1.6)(H2O)(0.4) (mmen-Mg-2(dobpdc)). This compound displays an exceptional capacity for CO2 adsorption at low pressures, taking up 2.0 mmol/g (8.1 wt %) at 0.39 mbar and 25 degrees C, conditions relevant to removal of CO2 from air, and 3.14 mmol/g (12.1 wt %) at 0.15 bar and 40 degrees C, conditions relevant to CO2 capture from flue gas. Dynamic gas adsorption/desorption cycling experiments demonstrate that mmen-Mg-2(dobpdc) can be regenerated upon repeated exposures to simulated air and flue gas mixtures, with cycling capacities of 1.05 mmol/g (4.4 wt %) after 1 h of exposure to flowing 390 ppm CO2 in simulated air at 25(degrees)C and 2.52 mmol/g (9.9 wt %) after 15 min of exposure to flowing 15% CO2 in N-2 at 40 degrees C. The purity of the CO2 removed from dry air and flue gas in these processes was estimated to be 96% and 98%, respectively. As a flue gas adsorbent, the regeneration energy was estimated through differential scanning calorimetry experiments to be 2.34 MJ/kg CO2 adsorbed. Overall, the performance characteristics of mmen-Mg-2(dobpdc) indicate it to be an exceptional new adsorbent for CO2 capture, comparing favorably with both amine-grafted silicas and aqueous amine solutions.";2012;1;0;
Modification of the Mg/DOBDC MOF with Amines to Enhance CO2 Adsorption from Ultradilute Gases;The MOF Mg/DOBDC has one of the highest known CO2 adsorption capacities at the low to moderate CO2 partial pressures relevant for CO2 capture from flue gas but is difficult to regenerate for use in cyclic operation. In this work, Mg/DOBDC is modified by functionalization of its open metal coordination sites with, ethylene diamine (ED) to introduce pendent amines into the MOP micropores. DFT calculations and experimental nitrogen physisorption and thermogravimetric analysis suggest that 1 ED molecule is added to each unit cell, on average. This modification both increases the material's CO2 adsorption capacity at ultradilute CO2 partial pressures and increases the regenerability of the material, allowing for cyclic adsorption-desorption cycles with identical adsorption capacities. This is one of the first MOF materials demonstrated to yield significant adsorption capacities from simulated ambient air (400 ppm CO2), and its capacity is competitive with the best-known adsorbents based on amine-oxide composites.;2012;1;0;
Dynamic separation of ultradilute CO2 with a nanoporous amine-based sorbent;An alternative amine-based sorbent (RFAS) was developed in this work. RFAS was assessed under various conditions. Studies show that the CO2 sorption capacities of RFAS increase considerably with N loading, slowly with increasing temperature (apparently contrary to the prediction with the isothermal equation of exothermic sorption), and gradually with the decease of gas flow rate in the tested range. In addition, CO2 sorption capacity increases and then decreases as the H2O:CO2 mole ratio increases, and the stoichiometric ratio 1:1 is the turning point. The CO2 sorption capacities achieved by RFAS with 8.07 mmol N/g for air with 400 ppm CO2 and the CO2-N-2 gas mixtures containing 1 vol% CO2 are 1.78 mmol CO2/g and 1.92 mmol CO2/g, respectively, higher than those reported in the most recent literature. A kinetic model corresponding to three proposed pathways is derived and expected to quantitatively predict the CO2 sorption characteristics given that the involved parameters can be established in the future. The half-CO2-adsorption and desorption times of RFAS along with temperatures are used to evaluate the dynamics of the sorbent. The adsorbed CO2 can be completely desorbed at only 80 degrees C within as short as 30 min. Low temperature desorption not only leads to the decrease in energy consumption but also benefits the structure stability of RFAS. The CO2 sorption capacities of RFAS within 10 sorption-desorption cycles are repeatable. All the results confirm that RFAS is a highly adsorptive, reversibly dynamic, and regenerable sorbent for capture of ultradilute CO2 from gas mixtures. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Evaluation of a Primary Amine-Functionalized Ion-Exchange Resin for CO2 Capture;A primary amine-functionalized polymeric ion-exchange resin (Lewatit VP OC 1065, Lanxess) was evaluated for use in CO, capture applications. The polymeric resin was characterized by SEM, DRIFTS-IR, N-2 adsorption isotherms, and packed bed sorption measurements to determine some of the characteristic properties of the resin. Capture capacities ranging from 1.85 to 1.15 mol CO2/kg sorbent were obtained in a packed bed reactor exposed to 10 vol % CO2 in N-2 at adsorption temperatures ranging from 30 to 70 degrees C. The capture capacity of the resin was stable over 18 adsorption/regeneration cycles. The resin was evaluated through thermogravimetric analysis to have a low moisture adsorption (1.5 mol H2O/kg sorbent). It is possible to completely regenerate the resin under 1 atm of CO2 at 200 degrees C.;2012;0;0;
CARBON DIOXIDE CAPTURE FROM AIR: A SIMPLE ANALYSIS;A simplified analysis is presented in order to compare direct capture of carbon dioxide from air, i.e. air capture, and capture from fossil fuelled power plants. For air capture the literature shows conflicting data on the estimates of the costs of the technology, which range from 30 US$/t CO2 to $1000 US$/t CO2. This clearly creates uncertainty especially for those who have to implement long term policies to mitigate climate change. The aim of this contribution is not to assign a fixed cost to air capture, but to show that it is possible to make a common sense estimate of the ratios of cost and energy requirement of air capture compared to carbon capture from power plants. These ratios are at least 10 times for the cost and 3 to 4 times for the energy needed to produce a high purity carbon dioxide stream at atmospheric pressure.;2012;1;1;
UK CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE, WHERE IS IT?;Carbon capture and storage, to capture CO2 from power plants and big industry, remains much publicised, much talked about as an essential action against climate change, and intensively analysed and costed. However only four governments have had the courage to provide actual or allocated commercial funding to enable the first integrated projects to occur. The UK has experimented with several proposed funding mechanisms, and with several proposed designs for full-scale projects. However perceived expense remains a persistent blockage from the government perspective. And from the company perspective, perceived risk remains the critical disincentive. The UK has abundant storage which is ready to develop. CCS on gas (or maybe coal) fuelled plant is seen as the ideal compliment to variable wind power, and so is critical to the UK's future electricity delivery planning. What many analysts miss is that CO2 storage will also be vital to any negative emissions strategy either co-firing with biomass, or direct capture form the air both need to bury CO2. How will CO2 storage be validated for commercial use? And how will commercial markets innovate and fund the integrated and expensive projects if UK Government refuses to take on risk?;2012;1;1;
Air as the renewable carbon source of the future: an overview of CO2 capture from the atmosphere;The burning of our diminishing fossil fuel reserves is accompanied by a large anthropogenic CO2 release, which is outpacing nature's CO2 recycling capability, causing significant environmental harm. Much is being done to avert this crisis including more efficient technology for usage, savings and replacing carbon fuels with alternatives whenever feasible. The capture of CO2 followed by sequestration (CCS) into geologic formation or under the seas has also been proposed and in some cases implemented. Carbon capture and recycling (CCR) to fuels and materials is another promising approach. At first, capturing carbon dioxide from concentrated sources such as fossil fuel burning power plants, industrial plants and natural sources might be the most practical. However, the capture of CO2 from the atmosphere is also technically feasible despite its low concentration (similar to 390 ppm) and presents even some benefits compared to point source CO2 capture. The present article reviews methods developed for the capture of CO2 directly from the air as well as their advantages and drawbacks. While strong bases such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide could be used, their regeneration is energy intensive, requiring high temperatures. Amines either physically or chemically immobilized on solid supports require much lower temperatures for their regeneration and are therefore promising candidates.;2012;1;0;review
Analysis of Equilibrium-Based TSA Processes for Direct Capture of CO2 from Air;Direct capture of CO2 from air is a concept that, if successfully implemented, could lead to capture of CO2 from disperse sources. We have developed process models to consider the viability of adsorption-based air capture technologies. Our models focus on using an amino-modified silica adsorbent, TRI-PE-MCM-41, and a structured monolithic contactor unit. We have studied several different temperature swing adsorption processes using the purity of CO2 and annual product throughput as metrics for comparing process performance. This analysis identifies some of the operational parameters, adsorbent characteristics, and other factors that have a significant effect on the performance of the process. Using the total energy requirement of the process and available sources of energy, such as low pressure steam and electricity, we carry out an economic analysis to obtain a net operating cost for air capture of CO2. We identify a process with a daily throughput of similar to 1.1 t CO2 at 88.5% purity using standard shipping container sized air capture units. The total energy required (6745 MJ/t CO2) is dominated by the parasitic losses-sensible heat requirements of the contactor (40%) and the adsorbent (28%) and not by the mechanical energy associated with air flow (similar to 5%). On the basis of our analysis of factors such as source of electricity, availability of low pressure steam, and geographic location, the net operating cost of capture is estimated to be similar to$100/t CO2. These cost estimates do not include capital expenses necessary to construct or maintain the air capture units. Potential strategies for further reducing the energy and monetary cost of these processes are identified. Our analysis supports continued work to establish the technological and economic feasibility of adsorption-based air capture.;2012;1;1;
Dramatic Enhancement of CO2 Uptake by Poly(ethyleneimine) UsingZirconosilicate Supports;The CO2 adsorption characteristics of prototypical poly(ethyleneimine)/silica composite adsorbents can be drastically enhanced by altering the acid/base properties of the oxide support via incorporation of Zr into the silica support. Introduction of an optimal amount of Zr resulted in a significant improvement in the CO2 capacity and amine efficiency under dilute (simulated flue gas) and ultradilute (simulated ambient air) conditions. Adsorption experiments combined with detailed characterization by thermogravimetric analysis, temperature-programmed desorption, and in situ FT-IR spectroscopy clearly demonstrate a stabilizing effect of amphoteric Zr sites that enhances the adsorbent capacity, regenerability, and stability over continued recycling. It is suggested that the important role of the surface properties of the oxide support in these polymer/oxide composite adsorbents has been largely overlooked and that the properties may be even further enhanced in the future by tuning the acid/base properties of the support.;2012;1;0;
Aging and Free Volume in a Polymer of Intrinsic Microporosity (PIM-1);There is a growing market for polymeric gas separation membranes for applications such as air separation and carbon dioxide capture. One of the key properties dominating transport is the free volume between atoms, allowing gas diffusion. However, thin films, in particular, undergo aging, decreasing free volume, and, hence, performance with time.We have measured the change in free volume during aging of thin films of a polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM-1) by depth-resolved positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy. For films with thickness, d, smaller than 1 mu m, aging is nearly complete after 3 months, whereas for films with d>1 mu m aging continues even after several months. Aging is thickness-and time-dependent and the free volume diffuses through the film to the free surface.;2012;0;0;
Metaphors We Die By? Geoengineering, Metaphors, and the Argument From Catastrophe;"Geoengineering the climate by reflecting sunlight or extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere has attracted increasing attention from natural scientists, social scientists, policy makers and the media. This article examines promotional discourse related to geoengineering from the 1980s to 2010. It asks in particular how this option for dealing with the problems posed by climate change were framed through the use of conceptual and discourse metaphors and whether one can argue that these are metaphors we ""live by"" or metaphors we might ""die by."" Findings show that an overarching argument from catastrophe was bolstered by three conceptual master-metaphors, namely ""THE PLANET IS A BODY,"" ""THE PLANET IS A MACHINE,"" and "" THE PLANET IS A PATIENT/ADDICT,"" linked to a variety of discourse metaphors, older conceptual metaphors, and cliches. This metaphorical landscape began to shift while the article was being written and will have to be closely monitored in the future.";2012;0;0;metaphors
Oxygen Transport Membranes for Ultra-Supercritical (USC) Power Plants With Very Low CO2 Emissions;Coal combustion for electric power generation is one of the major contributors to anthropogenic CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies are currently intensively investigated in order to mitigate CO2 emissions. The technique which is currently the most pursued is post combustion scrubbing of the flue gas, due to the potential to retrofit post combustion capture to existing power plants. However, it also comes with a substantial energy penalty. To reduce the energy demand of CO2 processing, the so-called oxyfuel technology presents an option to increase the concentration of CO2 in the flue gas. Here, the coal is burned in a mixture of oxygen and recycled flue gas. Hence, the flue gas primarily consists of CO2 and water vapor, which can be easily condensed. In general, there are two different techniques for oxygen production in oxyfuel power plants: cryogenic air separation (it is a method which can be easily implemented since it is already well established in industry) and a mixed metal oxide ceramic membrane (ITM or OTM) operating at high temperatures (it is a new process for O-2 production, which is under development). In the last ten years, efforts in the efficient utilization of energy and reduction of emissions have indirectly stimulated research in mixed conducting membranes. In fact, the presently available cryogenic air separation process consumes a significant fraction of the generating plant's output and reduces its efficiency. Oxygen transport membrane (OTM) integration with an ultra-supercritical (USC) power plant is, indeed, considered a promising technology that will lead to economic and energy savings compared to the previous solution. In this paper, we discuss the actual potentialities and limits of OTM and their integration in USC power plants. [DOI: 10.1115/1.4006482];2012;0;0;
An air-liquid contactor for large-scale capture of CO2 from air;We present a conceptually simple method for optimizing the design of a gas-liquid contactor for capture of carbon dioxide from ambient air, or 'air capture'. We apply the method to a slab geometry contactor that uses components, design and fabrication methods derived from cooling towers. We use mass transfer data appropriate for capture using a strong NaOH solution, combined with engineering and cost data derived from engineering studies performed by Carbon Engineering Ltd, and find that the total costs for air contacting alone-no regeneration-can be of the order of $60 per tonne CO2. We analyse the reasons why our cost estimate diverges from that of other recent reports and conclude that the divergence arises from fundamental design choices rather than from differences in costing methodology. Finally, we review the technology risks and conclude that they can be readily addressed by prototype testing.;2012;1;1;
Concurrent Separation of CO2 and H2O from Air by a Temperature-Vacuum Swing Adsorption/Desorption Cycle;A temperature-vacuum swing (TVS) cyclic process is applied to an amine-functionalized nanofibrilated cellulose sorbent to concurrently extract CO2 and water vapor from ambient air. The promoting effect of the relative humidity on the CO2 capture capacity and on the amount of coadsorbed water is quantified. The measured specific CO2 capacities range from 0.32 to 0.65 mmol/g, and the corresponding specific H2O capacities range from 0.87 to 4.76 mmol/g for adsorption temperatures varying between 10 and 30 degrees C and relative humidities varying between 20 and 80%. Desorption of CO2 is achieved at 95 degrees C and 50 mbar(abs) without dilution by a purge gas, yielding a purity exceeding 94.4%. Sorbent stability and a closed mass balance for both H2O and CO2 are demonstrated for ten consecutive adsorption-desorption cycles. The specific energy requirements of the TVS process based on the measured H2O and CO2 capacities are estimated to be 12.5 kJ/mol(CO2) of mechanical (pumping) work and between 493 and 640 kJ/mol(CO2) of heat at below 100 degrees C, depending on the air relative humidity. For a targeted CO2 capacity of 2 mmol/g, the heat requirement would be reduced to between 272 and 530 kJ/mol(CO2), depending strongly on the amount of coadsorbed water.;2012;1;0;
The urgency of the development of CO2 capture from ambient air;CO2 capture and storage (CCS) has the potential to develop into an important tool to address climate change. Given society's present reliance on fossil fuels, widespread adoption of CCS appears indispensable for meeting stringent climate targets. We argue that for conventional CCS to become a successful climate mitigation technology-which by necessity has to operate on a large scale-it may need to be complemented with air capture, removing CO2 directly from the atmosphere. Air capture of CO2 could act as insurance against CO2 leaking from storage and furthermore may provide an option for dealing with emissions from mobile dispersed sources such as automobiles and airplanes.;2012;1;1;
Membrane processes for carbon capture from coal-fired power plant flue gas: A modeling and cost study;Favorable economics of electricity generation will be crucial to the successful implementation of post-combustion carbon capture. Hence, the US DOE has set a goal of <35% for the increase on the cost of electricity (CUE) due to CO2 capture. For meeting this goal, there is thus a growing need to perform a cost analysis of emerging separation methods. This paper goes through a detailed modeling and cost-sensitivity study of a promising membrane-based process for carbon capture: the air-sweep process. We have studied the impact of membrane performance, selectivity and permeance, on the CUE increase and the capture cost. The effects of operating parameters as well as the membrane price on the overall cost were determined. Cost calculations show a CUE increase of about 33% along with a capture cost of <$24/t CO2 for the air-sweep process to achieve 90% CO2 recovery and 95% purity of the CO2 product. This process operates at close to atmospheric feed pressure and requires a low membrane module price of $27/m(2), a CO2/N-2 selectivity of about 140 combined with a high CO2 permeance of 3000 GPU. Although the required membrane properties have not yet been achieved, this research emphasizes quantitatively the need to improve the present membranes to realize a purely membrane-based process for the above application.

Capturing carbon dioxide from air using a fixed carrier facilitated transport membrane;This paper reports the facilitated separation process of carbon dioxide (CO2) from air using polyethylenimine (PEI)-poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/polyethersulphone (PES) hollow fibre composite membranes. The membranes were prepared by coating a thin layer of PEI-PVA on PES hollow fibre membranes. The prepared membranes were assembled and tested for CO2 permeance and CO2/N-2 selectivity using compressed air as the feed. The effects of the PEI concentration and drying temperature for the preparation of composite membranes were investigated, the operation conditions were optimised, and the capability of capturing CO2 from air was evaluated using these membranes. The drying temperature for maximising the CO2 reaction was found to be 100 degrees C. It was found that the separation performance increased when the PEI concentration increased. The highest permeance for a membrane containing 6% PEI was 1.4 x 10(-7) mol m(-2) s(-1) Pa-1 with a CO2/N-2 selectivity of up to 300 at a lower pressure (1 bar). At a higher feed pressure (3 bar), the permeance increased by 300% from 2.6 x 10(-8) mol m(-2) s(-1) Pa-1 to 7.7 x 10(-8) mol m(-2) s(-1) Pa-1 when the feed flow rate was increased. By using 6% PEI in the membrane active layer, a CO2 concentration of up to 0.8% was collected on the permeate side at the higher feed pressure (3 bar). These results clearly show that CO2 can be concentrated from air by a facilitated transport mechanism.;2012;1;0;
Role of Amine Structure on Carbon Dioxide Adsorption from Ultradilute Gas Streams such as Ambient Air;A fundamental study on the adsorption properties of primary, secondary, and tertiary amine materials is used to evaluate what amine type(s) are best suited for ultradilute CO2 capture applications. A series of comparable materials comprised of primary, secondary, or tertiary amines ligated to a mesoporous silica support via a propyl linker are used to systematically assess the role of amine type. Both CO2 and water adsorption isotherms are presented for these materials in the range relevant to CO2 capture from ambient air and it is demonstrated that primary amines are the best candidates for CO2 capture from air. Primary amines possess both the highest amine efficiency for CO2 adsorption as well as enhanced water affinity compared to other amine types or the bare silica support. The results suggest that the rational design of amine adsorbents for the extraction of CO2 from ambient air should focus on adsorbents rich in primary amines.;2012;1;0;
High-performance CO2 sorbents from algae;Highly porous N-doped carbon materials with apparent surface areas in the 1300-2400 m(2) g(-1) range and pore volumes up to 1.2 cm(3) g(-1) have been synthesized from hydrothermal carbons obtained from mixtures of algae and glucose. The porosity of these materials is made up of uniform micropores, most of them having sizes <1 nm. Moreover, they have N contents in the 1.1-4.7 wt% range, and the heteroatom is mainly a pyridone-type structure. These microporous carbons present unprecedented large CO2 capture capacities, up to 7.4 mmol g(-1) (1 bar, 0 degrees C). The importance of the pore size on the CO2 capture capacity of microporous carbon materials is clearly demonstrated. Indeed, a good correlation between the CO2 capture capacity at sub-atmospheric pressure and the volume of narrow micropores is observed. The results suggest that pyridinic-N, pyridonic/pyrrolic-N and quaternary-N do not contribute significantly to the CO2 adsorption capacity, owing probably to their low basicity in comparison with amines. These findings will help the design of high-performance CO2 capture sorbents.;2012;1;0;

A comparative global assessment of potential negative emissions technologies;The paper summarises a global assessment of around 30 prospective negative emissions techniques (NETs) found in the literature. Fourteen techniques including direct air capture, BECCS, biochar, and ocean alkalinity enhancement are considered in more detail.The novel functional categorisation of NETs developed in the course of the assessment is set out and a comparative quantitative summary of the results is presented, focusing on the relative readiness, global capacity, costs and side-effects of the prospective NETs.Both technology specific and more generic potential limitations are discussed, notably those arising from energy requirements, from availability of geological storage capacity and from sustainable supply of biomass.Conclusions are drawn regarding the overall scope of NETs to contribute to safe carbon budgets, and challenges arising in the future governance of NETs, with particular reference to the potential role of carbon markets.

High-level techno-economic assessment of negative emissions technologies;This paper presents results from research conducted to provide a high level techno-economic and performance assessments of various emerging technologies for capturing CO2 from the air, directly and indirectly, on a life-cycle basis. The technologies assessed include 'artificial trees', the soda lime process, augmented ocean disposal, biochar and bio-energy with carbon capture and storage.These technologies are subjected to quantitative and qualitative analyses, based on the most recent peer reviewed data in the literature, to identify their potential performance as well as the technical and non-technical barriers to their adoption and scale up. Key findings for each technology are presented which seek to highlight the state of technological development and research needs, the anticipated life cycle capture cost in $/tCO(2) based on their potential to deliver a 0.1 ppm CO2 reduction per annum, policy requirements for scale up and, in light of these findings, the likely role that they will play in addressing climate change and broader environmental issues in the medium to long term.The key finding from the work is that the degree of scale-up required for negative emissions technologies to have a material impact on atmospheric emissions (i.e. at a ppm level) is probably unrealistic in less than 20 years. Therefore, emissions prevention efforts should remain the main focus in addressing climate change and the likely role for negative emissions technologies will be in augmenting a suite of mitigation measures targeting economically or practically difficult emissions.

Enhanced CO2 Adsorption over Polymeric Amines Supported on Heteroatom-Incorporated SBA-15 Silica: Impact of Heteroatom Type and Loading on Sorbent Structure and Adsorption Performance;Silica supported amine materials are promising compositions that can be used to effectively remove CO2 from large stationary sources, such as flue gas generated from coal-fired power plants (ca. 10?% CO2) and potentially from ambient air (ca. 400 ppm CO2). The CO2 adsorption characteristics of prototypical poly(ethyleneimine)silica composite adsorbents can be significantly enhanced by altering the acid/base properties of the silica support by heteroatom incorporation into the silica matrix. In this study, an array of poly(ethyleneimine)-impregnated mesoporous silica SBA-15 materials containing heteroatoms (Al, Ti, Zr, and Ce) in their silica matrices are prepared and examined in adsorption experiments under conditions simulating flue gas (10?% CO2 in Ar) and ambient air (400 ppm CO2 in Ar) to assess the effects of heteroatom incorporation on the CO2 adsorption properties. The structure of the composite adsorbents, including local information concerning the state of the incorporated heteroatoms and the overall surface properties of the silicate supports, are investigated in detail to draw a relationship between the adsorbent structure and CO2 adsorption/desorption performance. The CO2 adsorption/desorption kinetics are assessed by thermogravimetric analysis and in situ FT-IR measurements. These combined results, coupled with data on adsorbent regenerability, demonstrate a stabilizing effect of the heteroatoms on the poly(ethyleneimine), enhancing adsorbent capacity, adsorption kinetics, regenerability, and stability of the supported aminopolymers over continued cycling. It is suggested that the CO2 adsorption performance of silicaaminopolymer composites may be further enhanced in the future by more precisely tuning the acid/base properties of the support.;2012;1;0;
We're all in it together;Simon Drew describes how scientists are sharing their knowledge to turn research into action to cut carbon losses from the landscape. Plants use photosynthesis to extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in solid form in their bodies. In peatlands plants do not decompose fully when they die and the carbon they contain is then stored in the peat which is formed. It has taken decades for researchers to realize the effects of these activities, and in some places efforts are under way to repair the damage. But modern developments continue to pose a threat. One of these, which has received little attention so far but is likely to become increasingly important, is wind farms. CLAD aims to improve management practice through a variety of activities, some planned in advance, others ad hoc.;2012;0;0;
Systems analysis and cost estimates for large scale capture of carbon dioxide from air;"This paper explores the resource intensity and major cost elements of direct air capture of carbon dioxide. The levelized cost of carbon removal is calculated as the sum of costs resulting from interdependent capture devices, energy supplies, water supplies and sequestration resources. The analysis considers ""generic"" air capture technology characterized only by its energy use, capture footprint, and water use. Capital costs dominate the analysis, followed by energy efficiency. Four dedicated energy resources are considered: wind, enhanced geothermal, natural gas combined cycle (NGCC), and NGCC with 90% carbon capture. Nearly carbon-free energy is critical to keeping overall cost of carbon mitigation low. The analysis shows that high second law capture efficiencies (on the order of 10%) and relatively inexpensive capture devices (on the order $0.5M for an individual device capturing one tonne CO2/day) must be achieved if the cost of air capture is to approach $300/tonne-CO2. Reaching those goals is likely to require substantial research into the kinetics and thermodynamics of capture chemistry which, respectively, keep the capital and energy costs as low as possible. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.";2011;1;1;
Is all CCS equal? Classifying CCS applications by their potential climate benefit;Policies to develop and deploy CCS as a tool for climate change mitigation should consider the key differences between three classes of CCS projects: carbon-positive, near carbon-neutral and potentially carbon-negative. In class 1 are projects that are 'carbon positive' since they capture CO2 from the production of fossil hydrocarbon fuels and there is no guarantee that the CO2 generated when these are used will be captured and stored. Class 1 CCS might be treated as a condition of the 'licence to operate' for hydrocarbon production projects that emit large amounts of CO2, and be distinguished from other classes of CCS projects in any incentive framework. In the event of serious global action on climate change, it seems likely that class 1 CCS would be employed to minimise fossil fuel supply chain CO 2 emissions, but in addition all fossil fuels would need to be used with class 2, near carbon neutral, CCS, so that the vast majority of fossil carbon is captured and stored and the main products are decarbonised energy vectors such as electricity, hydrogen and heat. Class 2 CCS projects are generally more expensive than class 1 projects and require more novel technologies, so they are unlikely to be widely deployed at present without specific incentives, an analogous situation to that for many renewable generation technologies. Carbon negative class 3 projects, where biomass use and CCS are combined, or where CO2 is captured directly from the air, could also be important since they have the potential to achieve a net reduction in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, as well as to offset residual emissions from other classes of CCS. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.;2011;1;1;
Simplified dynamic life cycle assessment model of CO2 compression, transportation and injection phase within carbon capture and storage;Carbon capture and storage is significant technology in the limitation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere worldwide. Carbon capture and storage consists of four general processes within the system: carbon capture, carbon compression and transport, carbon injection and carbon storage. All the processes require energy to operate the system and therefore produce additional amount of carbon dioxide emissions. The energy penalty decreases the efficiency of the plant: the total conditional efficiency of the CCS system is often characterised as difference between CO2 emissions eliminated by CCS and CO2 emissions produced by CCS processes. Additionally, CCS is associated with environmental, safety and human consequences because of CO2 leakage from storage sites and its impact to ecosystems, stability of geological layers and changes in geological properties of formations, etc. This paper is aimed at the identification and optimisation of costs and the environmental impact categories caused by energy consumption at a CCS power plant for the realization of carbon compression, pipeline transport and carbon injection phases. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.;2011;0;0;
Senators question cost, lack of applications for greenhouse gas storage plans;Researchers and lawmakers alike are looking for ways to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere because of its contribution to global climate change. The goal of the Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee hearing was to get feedback on a pair of CCS (carbon capture and sequestration) bills that have been reintroduced in the Senate. Of the two bills, discussion of S. 699, an amendment to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 that would allow the Department of Energy to provide technical and financial help to 10 commercial-scale projects on integrated CCS systems, dominated the hearing. The second bill (S. 757), which garnered less interest from the senators, provides incentives to encourage the development and implementation of technology to capture significant amounts of CO2 from dilute sources using direct air capture. National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) is looking into technologies to drive the costs of CO2 capture down by two-thirds so the oil and gas industry could consider using CO2 obtained by CCS in the future.;2011;1;1;
Solid-supported amines for extraction of CO2 from ultra-low concentration sources such as ambient air;Direct CO2 capture from ambient air offers the potential to be a truly carbon negative technology, but it represents a significant technical challenge, owing to the low ambient CO2 concentration. We show here that the amine-based solid adsorbents have the ability to efficiently extract CO2 from the ambient air, yielding large adsorption capacities. Specifically, the air capture characteristics of hyperbranched aminosilica (HAS) materials and PEI-impregnated silica materials are evaluated using CO2 mixtures that simulate ambient atmospheric concentrations (400 ppm CO2), as well as more traditional conditions simulating flue gas (10% CO2). The air capture experiments demonstrate that the adsorption capacity and the maximum apparent adsorption rate the adsorbents are only marginally influenced by the significant dilution of the CO2 concentration by a factor of 250.

Amine-functionalized mesoporous alumina for CO 2 capture from flue gas or ambient air: Preparation, capture capacity and stability;"Driven by the raising concentration of atmospheric CO 2 and its implications for global climate change, technologies for carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) have extensively been developed during the past decade. In the post-combustion capture of CO 2 from flue gas streams, absorption by amine-based aqueous solutions is a benchmark technology; however, this process suffers from energy-intensive regeneration requirements, oxidative degradation of the aqueous amines, as well as the corrosion of process equipment. As one of the emerging CCS technologies, adsorption of CO 2 by several classes of solid adsorbents has been investigated. Specifically, solid-supported amines show great capture performance at low temperature. Recently, we reported the first description of steam-stripping for the regeneration of supported amine adsorbents utilizing low-grade, low-cost steam that offers potential for ""real"" extraction of CO 2 from other gases. For realizing such regeneration concept, the development of adsorbents possessing long-term stability under steam is a crucial step. Thus far, most of solid-supported amines have utilized silica as solid supports that could degrade upon exposure to steam. In this presentation, we describe syntheses of mesoporous alumina and amine-impregnated mesoporous alumina, and their performance in the capture of CO 2 from simulated flue gas and simulated ambient air. In addition, the steam stability of alumina-supported adsorbents was evaluated and compared with that of silica-supported ones. The mesoporous alumina synthesized by surfactant-mediated self-assembly of pseudobomite nanoparticles exhibited comparable surface area, large pore volume, and large and narrow mesopores that could accumulate polymeric amines up to 55% by weight. CO 2 capture capacity using simulated flue gas and simulated ambient air obtained on the mesoporous alumina-supported amine adsorbents were slightly higher than those of SBA-15 mesoporous silica-supported materials. Additionally, temperature-programmed desorption of CO 2 results suggested that CO 2 binds to alumina-supported adsorbents somewhat stronger than the silica-supported ones. More importantly, the CO 2 capture capacity on alumina-supported adsorbents was only slightly reduced after treatment under harsh steam conditions; while, CO 2 capture capacity of silica-based adsorbents was drastically decreased. Overall, these results suggest that amine-functionalized mesoporous alumina is a promising material for CO 2 adsorption-steam stripping processes.";2011;1;0;
CO2 plume modeling in deep saline reservoirs by 2D ERT in boreholes;The need to manage CO2 emissions for mitigating the greenhouse effect has led to worldwide research to reduce atmospheric CO2. Techniques of carbon capture and storage (CCS) must (1) be effective and cost-competitive, (2) provide stable, long-term storage, and (3) be environmentally benign. Potential terrestrial media for CO2 storage include depleted oil and gas reservoirs, coal seams that cannot be mined, and deep saline water reservoirs capped by impermeable rock to prevent upward leakage. © 2011 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.;2011;0;0;
The development of web-based GIS application for agroforestry carbon sequestration offset project in Thailand;"Advances of agroforestry are known to provide rural people much potential in both struggling out their poverty and mitigating of firm damaged caused by uncontrollable weathers. Changing of cultivation systems from single annually plant cultivation to multi-specie cultivation with various trees and perennial woody plants included can reduce the severities of climate change by capturing more atmospheric carbon dioxidejg and converting into woody and soiled biomasses. Canopy difference works better in hedging the areas from erratic and extreme climates. Beyond traditional timber and non-timber products, cultivations with agroforestry system also provide farmers a new valuable product which is tradable m certain markets; the carbon. The carbon, a kind of greenhouse causing gas trapped in biomass form, can be counted and amounts of it can be possibly traded at present.

Guiding and measuring electron transfers in biomolecules: Lessons for photovoltaics, materials, and medicine;"My interests span energy generation, biomolecular materials, and protein-protein dynamics. As a graduate student with Matt Francis, I developed a biomolecular platform for optoelectronic materials. Tobacco Mosaic Virus served as a scaffold from which we assembled the components of a photovoltaic, using phthalocyanines as electron donors, carbon nanotubes as electon acceptors, and polymeric grafting to increase thermal stability. With Dan Nocera, and in collaboration with JoAnne Stubbe, I measured the mechanism of electron transport across 35 Å in Ribonucleotide Reductase. The installation of a rhenium phototrigger allowed us to photochemically initiate tyrosyl radical propagation in the enzyme, which we monitored using nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. As an independent researcher, I will explore a range of problems: the air capture of carbon dioxide and its concomitant transformation into hydrocarbon fuels; rigorous analysis of redox active metalloenzymes; and targeting and deciphering weak protein-protein dynamics for therapeutic purposes.";2011;0;0;
Engineering amine-based solid adsorbents for carbon capture from dilute CO 2 streams;A prominent methodology to tune the adsorption properties of solids for applications in CO2 capture is to functionalize them with amines sites, as the amine-CO2 interaction is strong under a variety of conditions. Specifically, amine-modified solids such as porous silicates and MOFs are now well-studied under conditions that simulate post-combustion CO2 capture. In addition, we have recently shown that supported amine materials are promising solids for removal of CO2 from ultra-dilute gas sources such as the ambient air. This talk will focus on the engineering of inorganic-organic hybrids amine adsorbents to enhance their CO 2 adsorption performance, with a specific focus on CO 2 adsorption capacity, adsorption kinetics and stability to practical desorption conditions. The structures of various hybrid silica-based and MOF-based adsorbents were modified by tuning the both the host substrate and the surface amine functionalities. Structure-property relationships for these materials are under development, and based on these studies, we will discuss the potential to design inorganic-organic hybrid adsorbents with desired CO 2 adsorption characteristics, such as the ability to extract CO 2 efficiently from ambient air.;2011;1;0;
Dust removal technolgy for a mars in Situ Resource Utilization system;Several In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) systems being considered to enable future manned exploration of Mars require capture of Martian atmospheric gas to extract oxygen and other commodities. However, the Martian atmosphere contains relatively large amounts of dust which must be removed in the collection systems of the ISRU chambers. The amount of atmospheric dust varies largely with the presence of daily dust devils and the less frequent but much more powerful global dust storms. A common and mature dust removal technology for terrestrial systems is the electrostatic precipitator. With this technology, dust particles being captured are imparted an electrostatic charge by means of a corona discharge. Charged dust particles are then driven to a region of high electric field which forces the particles onto a collector for capture. Several difficulties appear when this technology is adapted to the Martian atmospheric environment. At the low atmospheric pressure of Mars, electrical breakdown occurs at much lower voltages than on Earth and corona discharge is difficult to sustain. In this paper, we report on our efforts to obtain a steady corona/glow discharge in a simulated Martian atmosphere of carbon dioxide at 9 millibars of pressure. We also present results on the design of a dust capture system under these atmospheric conditions.;2011;0;0;Mars exploration
Getting rid of atmospheric carbon: Sequestration and air capture;"Unlike alternative energy sources, or energy efficiency measures, carbon sequestration can only act to reduce CO2 atmospheric concentrations; it does not help solve our energy problems, and may even add to them. Several sequestration approaches are possible. Carbon capture and storage can only be applied to present emissions from large CO2 emitting sources such as power stations. Another possible approach is to capture CO2 directly from the air. Carbon sequestration in forests, soils, or in ocean plankton, are of this type, as is mechanical air capture. Mechanical air capture can in principle also draw down past CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, and even compensate for emissions of other greenhouse gases. However, the energy costs for capture are very high, so that energy availability becomes a problem. The sequestration phase is the same as for CO2 from fossil fuel combustion. Sequestering CO2 in the deep ocean would lead to both ocean acidification and adverse consequences for marine life. Estimates for the quantity of CO2 that can be ultimately sequestered in geological formations such as disused oil and gas fields, and saline aquifers, both on land and in the seabed, vary by orders of magnitude. But such estimates may be beside the point, since sequestration requires not only that adequate safe geological storage capacity be available, but that CO2 can be safely introduced at the rate desired, which could amount worldwide to tens of Gigatonne of CO2 per year. Furthermore, there is a small risk of catastrophic blowout from injection wells, which means that local citizen opposition could be intense.";2011;1;1;
Coal char reactivity as a fuel selection criterion for coal-based hydrogen-rich gas production in the process of steam gasification;The fuel's reactivity can be defined as a parameter determining its processability in thermochemical processes applied to convert them into energy and/or energy carriers. It depends on many factors, like chemical composition and physical properties of a fuel as well as process parameters. As such it may provide important information on the process results in terms of product output and quality. In the paper the results of reactivity tests performed for Polish hard coals in the process of steam gasification in a fixed bed reactor system as well as the analysis of potential relationships between the reactivity and selected physical and chemical parameters of coal and products quality and quantity using chemometric method (principal component analysis) are presented. The analysis revealed a negative correlation between R-max and the total volume of synthesis gas produced in the process. This regularity was confirmed in the tests of steam gasification of coal to hydrogen-rich gas with CO2 capture under atmospheric pressure and at the temperature of 700 degrees C.

Application of Amine-Tethered Solid Sorbents for Direct CO2 Capture from the Ambient Air;"While current carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies for large point sources can help address the impact of CO2 buildup on global climate change, these technologies can at best slow the rate of increase of the atmospheric CO2 concentration. In contrast, the direct CO2 capture from ambient air offers the potential to be a truly carbon negative technology. We propose here that amine-based solid adsorbents have significant promise as key components of a hypothetical air capture process. Specifically, the CO2 capture characteristics of hyperbranched aminosilica (HAS) materials are evaluated here using CO2 mixtures that simulate ambient atmospheric concentrations (400 ppm CO2 = ""air capture"") as well as more traditional conditions simulating flue gas (10% CO2). The air capture experiments demonstrate that the adsorption capacity of HAS adsorbents are only marginally influenced even with a significant dilution of the CO2 concentration by a factor of 250, while capturing CO2 reversibly without significant degradation of performance in multicyclic operation. These results suggest that solid amine-based air capture processes, have the potential to be an effective approach to extracting CO2 from the ambient air.";2011;1;0;
The atmospheric signature of carbon capture and storage;Compared with other industrial processes, carbon capture and storage (CCS) will have an unusual impact on atmospheric composition by reducing the CO2 released from fossil-fuel combustion plants, but not reducing the associated O-2 loss. CO2 that leaks into the air from below-ground CCS sites will also be unusual in lacking the O-2 deficit normally associated with typical land CO2 sources, such as from combustion or ecosystem exchanges. CCS may also produce distinct isotopic changes in atmospheric CO2. Using simple models and calculations, we estimate the impact of CCS or leakage on regional atmospheric composition. We also estimate the possible impact on global atmospheric composition, assuming that the technology is widely adopted. Because of its unique signature, CCS may be especially amenable to monitoring, both regionally and globally, using atmospheric observing systems. Measurements of the O-2/N-2 ratio and the CO2 concentration in the proximity of a CCS site may allow detection of point leaks of the order of 1000 ton CO2 yr(-1) from a CCS reservoir up to 1km from the source. Measurements of O-2/N-2 and CO2 in background air from a global network may allow quantification of global and hemispheric capture rates from CCS to the order of +/- 0.4 PgCyr(-1).;2011;0;0;
Amine-Tethered Solid Adsorbents Coupling High Adsorption Capacity and Regenerability for CO2 Capture From Ambient Air;Silica supported poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) materials are prepared via impregnation and demonstrated to be promising adsorbents for CO2 capture from ultra-dilute gas streams such as ambient air. A prototypical class 1 adsorbent, containing 45 wt% PEI (PEI/silica), and two new modified PEI-based aminosilica adsorbents, derived from PEI modified with 3-amino-propyltrimethoxysilane (A-PEI/silica) or tetraethyl orthotitanate (T-PEI/silica), are prepared and characterized by using thermogravimetric analysis and FTIR spectroscopy. The modifiers are shown to enhance the thermal stability of the polymer-oxide composites, leading to higher PEI decomposition temperatures. The modified adsorbents present extremely high CO2 adsorption capacities under conditions simulating ambient air (400 ppm CO2 in inert gas), exceeding 2 mol(CO2) kg(sorbent)(-1), as well as enhanced adsorption kinetics compared to conventional class 1 sorbents. The new adsorbents show excellent stability in cyclic adsorption-desorption operations, even under dry conditions in which aminosilica adsorbents are known to lose capacity due to urea formation. Thus, the adsorbents of this type can be considered promising materials for the direct capture of CO2 from ultra-dilute gas streams such as ambient air.;2011;1;0;

Preliminary analysis of process flow sheet modifications for energy efficient CO2 capture from flue gases using chemical absorption;The energy penalty associated with solvent based capture of CO2 from power station flue gases can be reduced by incorporating process flow sheet modifications into the standard process. A review of modifications suggested in the open and patent literature identified several options, primarily intended for use in the gas processing industry. It was not immediately clear whether these options would have the same benefits when applied to CO2 capture from near atmospheric pressure combustion flue gases. Process flow sheet modifications, including split flow, rich split, vapour recompression, and inter-stage cooling, were therefore modelled using a commercial rate-based simulation package. The models were completed for a Queensland (Australia) based pilot plant running on 30% MEA as the solvent. The preliminary modelling results showed considerable benefits in reducing the energy penalty of capturing CO2 from combustion flue gases. Further work will focus on optimising and validating the most relevant process flow sheet modifications in a pilot plant. (C) 2011. The Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

CO2 Capture from Dilute Gases as a Component of Modern Global Carbon Management;The growing atmospheric CO2 concentration and its impact on climate have motivated widespread research and development aimed at slowing or stemming anthropogenic carbon emissions. Technologies for carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) employing mass separating agents that extract and purify CO2 from flue gas emanating from large point sources such as fossil fuel-fired electricity-generating power plants are under development. Recent advances in solvents, adsorbents, and membranes for postcombustion CO2 capture are described here. Specifically, room-temperature ionic liquids, supported amine materials, mixed matrix and facilitated transport membranes, and metal-organic framework materials are highlighted. In addition, the concept of extracting CO2 directly from ambient air (air capture) as a means of reducing the global atmospheric CO2 concentration is reviewed. For both conventional CCS from large point sources and air capture, critical research needs are identified and discussed.;2011;0;0;
Moisture Swing Sorbent for Carbon Dioxide Capture from Ambient Air;An amine-based anion exchange resin dispersed in a flat sheet of polypropylene was prepared in alkaline forms so that it would capture carbon dioxide from air, The resin, with quaternary ammonium cations attached to the polymer structure and hydroxide or carbonate groups as mobile counterions, absorbs carbon dioxide when dry and releases it when wet. In ambient air, the moist resin dries spontaneously and subsequently absorbs carbon dioxide. This constitutes a moisture induced cycle, which stands in contrast to thermal pressure swing based cycles. This paper aims to determine the isothermal performance of the sorbent during such a moisture swing. Equilibrium experiments show that the absorption and desorption process can be described well by a Langmuir isothermal model. The equilibrium partial pressure of carbon dioxide over the resin at a given loading state can be increased by 2 orders of magnitude by wetting the resin.;2011;1;0;
Separation of CO2 from air by temperature-vacuum swing adsorption using diamine-functionalized silica gel;A temperature-vacuum swing (TVS) process, capable of extracting pure CO2 from dry and humid atmospheric air, is experimentally analyzed. Adsorption/desorption cycles utilizing a packed bed of a sorbent material made of diamine-functionalized commercial silica gel are performed under equilibrium and non-equilibrium (short-cycle) conditions. Thereby, the CO2 capture capacity of the material is determined over a wide range of operational parameters, namely 10-150 mbar(abs) desorption pressure, 74-90 degrees C desorption temperature, and 0-80% relative humidity during adsorption. Up to 158 ml of CO2 (6.8 ml per gram sorbent) with a purity of up to 97.6% is recovered per cycle. Adsorption isotherms of the sorbent material are experimentally determined by thermogravimetry and fitted to isotherm models, which are successfully applied to predict desorption capacities achieved in the TVS process. Under dry conditions, desorption pressures above 100 mbar(abs) lead to strongly decreasing CO2 capture capacities below 0.03 mmol g(-1). Under humid conditions with 40% relative humidity during adsorption, the desorption pressure can be raised to 150 mbar(abs) with capture capacities remaining above 0.2 mmol g(-1). Stable performance of the sorbent material in the TVS process is demonstrated over 40 consecutive adsorption/desorption cycles.;2011;1;0;
Recent developments on carbon capture and storage: An overview;The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assumes the warming of the climate system, associating the increase of global average temperature to the observed increase of the anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is considered the most important GHG, due to the dependence of world economies on fossil fuels, since their combustion processes are the most important sources of this gas. CO2 concentrations are increasing in the last decades mainly due to the increase of anthropogenic emissions. The processes involving CO2 capture and storage is gaining attention on the scientific community as an alternative for decreasing CO2 emission, reducing its concentration in ambient air. However, several technological, economical and environmental issues as well as safety problems remain to be solved, such as the following needs: increase of CO2 capture efficiency, reduction of process costs, and verification of environmental sustainability of CO2 storage. This paper aims to review the recent developments (from 2006 until now) on the carbon capture and storage (CCS) methodologies. Special attention was focused on the basic findings achieved in CCS operational projects. (C) 2011 The Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2011;0;0;
A survey of process flow sheet modifications for energy efficient CO2 capture from flue gases using chemical absorption;The energy penalty associated with solvent based capture of CO2 from power station flue gases can be reduced by incorporating flow sheet modifications to the standard process. Fifteen process flow sheet modifications for chemical based CO2 absorption processes are reviewed, with a particular focus on the patent literature. The proposed flow sheet modifications identify potentially moderate to large improvements in the energy performance of the chemical absorption process. Most process modifications suggested in the patent literature report very little if any supporting experimental evidence. Where supporting data does exist it tends to be based on process modelling results. Moreover, earlier patents tend to focus on the gas processing industry and it is not immediately clear whether the same benefits can be extended to CO2 capture from near atmospheric pressure flue gases. It is clear from the survey that there is considerable scope for achieving improved process performance through process flow sheet modifications. However further process modelling and, in particular, experimental work focused on post-combustion CO2 capture is needed to map the technical potential for improvements. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Amine-Based Nanofibrillated Cellulose As Adsorbent for CO2 Capture from Air;A novel amine-based adsorbent for CO2 capture from air was developed, which uses biogenic raw materials and an environmentally benign synthesis route without organic solvents. The adsorbent was synthesized through freeze-drying an aqueous suspension of nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) and N-(2-aminoethyl)-3-aminopropylmethyldimethoxysilane (AEAPDMS). At a CO2 concentration of 506 ppm in air and a relative humidity of 40% at 25 degrees C, 1.39 mmol CO2/g was absorbed after 12 h.

Mesoporous Alumina-Supported Amines as Potential Steam-Stable Adsorbents for Capturing CO2 from Simulated Flue Gas and Ambient Air;Carbon management by a means of CO2 capture from large stationary sources such as coal-fired power plants or from ambient air is a significant global issue. In the context of steam-striping as a regeneration process for solid CO2 adsorbents, new adsorbent materials robust enough for direct contact with low temperature steam are needed. Here, mesoporous gamma-alumina-supported poly(ethyleneimine) composite materials are prepared and evaluated as effective CO2 adsorbents, using dilute CO2 streams such as simulated flue gas (10% CO2) and ultradilute streams such as simulated ambient air (400 ppm CO2). In comparison to the silica-supported amine adsorbents typically utilized for CO2 capture applications, the alumina-supported amine adsorbents give better performance in terms of both capture capacity and amine efficiency, in particular, at ambient air conditions. In addition, the alumina-supported amines are stable over short multicycle temperature swing tests and, more importantly, appear to be more robust than the silica-based counterparts upon direct contact with steam. Thus, the resulting alumina-supported amines are suggested to be promising new materials for CO2 capture processes equipped with steam-stripping regeneration, especially from ultradilute gas streams.;2011;1;0;
Carbon dioxide capture under ambient conditions using 2-chloroethylamine;This is the first case applying 2-haloethylamine to CO(2) capture. The prospect of global warming and the urgent need to reduce atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has prompted actions at many levels. The conventional capture of carbon dioxide is predominantly based on chemical absorption using ethanolamine. Recent developments of carbon dioxide capture focus on new materials, such as ionic liquids, zeolites, membranes, carbonaceous absorbents, and metal-organic frameworks. However, no unique solution exists currently to solve the problem of carbon dioxide capture. In order to examine the efficiency of 2-chloroethylamine as an absorbent of CO(2), we treated an aqueous solution of 2-chloroethylamine hydrochloride with CO(2) in the presence of an alkali, e.g., NaOH, under ambient conditions. The absorption was complete within 30 min, seemingly following first-order reaction kinetics. Furthermore, we succeeded in capturing CO(2) from ambient air using 2-chloroethanolamine. The efficiency of 2-chloroethylamine as an absorbent of CO(2) could be attributed to the production of stable 2-oxazolidinone, therefore, this reaction is favored thermodynamically. Compared with previously reported absorbents, this novel system is capable of capturing CO(2) with an extremely high efficiency of 1 mol per mol absorbent under ambient conditions, even from the atmosphere. This potential method could be used to capture CO(2) particularly from small, mobile, or low-concentration emission sources.;2011;1;0;

The composite adsorbents are shown to have comparable adsorption capacities to more-conventional poly(ethyleneirnine)-silica adsorbents. Potential advantages of poly(allylamine)-derived adsorbents are discussed.;2011;1;0;
Economic and energetic analysis of capturing CO2 from ambient air;"Capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (""air capture"") in an industrial process has been proposed as an option for stabilizing global CO2 concentrations. Published analyses suggest these air capture systems may cost a few hundred dollars per tonne of CO2, making it cost competitive with mainstream CO2 mitigation options like renewable energy, nuclear power, and carbon dioxide capture and storage from large CO2 emitting point sources. We investigate the thermodynamic efficiencies of commercial separation systems as well as trace gas removal systems to better understand and constrain the energy requirements and costs of these air capture systems. Our empirical analyses of operating commercial processes suggest that the energetic and financial costs of capturing CO2 from the air are likely to have been underestimated. Specifically, our analysis of existing gas separation systems suggests that, unless air capture significantly outperforms these systems, it is likely to require more than 400 kJ of work per mole of CO2, requiring it to be powered by CO2-neutral power sources in order to be CO2 negative. We estimate that total system costs of an air capture system will be on the order of $1,000 per tonne of CO2, based on experience with as-built large-scale trace gas removal systems.";2011;1;1;
Carbon Dioxide Capture from the Air Using a Polyamine Based Regenerable Solid Adsorbent;Easy to prepare solid materials based on fumed silica impregnated with polyethylenimine (PEI) were found to be superior adsorbents for the capture of carbon dioxide directly from air. During the initial hours of the experiments, these adsorbents effectively scrubbed all the CO(2) from the air despite its very low concentration. The effect of moisture on the adsorption characteristics and capacity was studied at room temperature. Regenerative ability was also determined in a short series of adsorption/desorption cycles.;2011;1;0;
A review of carbon dioxide capture and utilization by membrane integrated microalgal cultivation processes;The capture of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air for microalgal cultivation has received increasing interest since it allows advantages that do not only reduce the amount of CO2 already added to the air, but it is also more economical due to the accessibility of air, there are no regeneration requirements and it is a safe method that can help enhance microalgal growth. In order to capture CO2 from the air, it is necessary to deal with CO2 emissions from all sources in an atmosphere. Interestingly, the capture unit and microalgal culture can be located at any favorable site. Although a number of photobioreactors have been proposed with a CO2 distribution system, the consequence of CO2 losses is still being ignored. Thus, capturing CO2 from the air via an integrated separation process in a photobioreactor is required for microalgal cultivation. Among the four available separation technologies, the membrane separation process would offer a safe, reliable and low cost method for CO2 capture. Thus, this method of separation can be considered as a key factor in accelerating the development of a CO2 enrichment process from the air for microalgal cultivation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Feasibility of air capture;"Capturing CO 2 from air, referred to as air capture, is being proposed as a viable climate change mitigation technology. Technically, air capture is not a new technology; industrial applications can be traced back to the 1930s. This paper explores the feasibility of this technology as a climate change mitigation option. Two different pathways of air capture are assessed: direct air capture, which uses a chemical process to capture CO 2, and biomass coupled with CO 2 capture and storage (CCS), which utilizes the biological process of photosynthesis to remove CO 2 from the air. We find that direct air capture has prohibitively high mitigation costs compared to the costs of climate change mitigation options being considered today. The pathway of biomass coupled with CCS has much more reasonable costs and could be used to offset certain emissions. However, the large land requirement may limit the amount of offsets available. We conclude that relying on air capture technology to play a major role in mitigating carbon emissions is a very risky policy decision. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.";2011;1;1;
Artificial photosynthesis utilizing room temperature ionic liquids;Alternative energy and climate change are among the largest concerns facing scientists and engineers at the start of the twenty-first century. The focus of this research is the design of a system that can efficiently capture atmospheric carbon dioxide and reduce it to CO, a precursor for fuel synthesis. Rather than traditional solvents such as water, sulfuric acid, or acetonitrile, room temperature ionic liquids (RTIL's) will be employed as the solvent for CO 2 capture and reduction. RTIL's have many favorable properties such as extended electrochemical windows, high thermal stability, high electrical conductivity, and a 100+ fold increase in carbon dioxide solubility compared to water. Additionally, the absence of bulk water can increase the efficiency of CO production by eliminating the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. Cyclic voltammetry has shown the catalytic reduction of CO 2 at many transition metal cathode surfaces in imidazolium based ionic liquids such as EMIM BF4. Sum Frequency Generation (SFG) spectroscopy was used in identify reduced species and intermediates on the Pt surface. A CO2 conversion flow cell in series with a GC was used to evaluate the steady state performance of CO2 reduction on various metal cathodes.;2011;1;0;
Clean coal: A new power generation process with high efficiency, carbon capture and zero emissions;An environmentally friendly electricity generation process using coal gasification and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) produces electricity with high efficiency, 99.95% carbon capture and essentially zero atmospheric emissions. Coal is gasified into syngas, cleaned and shifted to hydrogen gas to fuel SOFCs. The primary waste products, CO2 and H2O, are separated with a very small energy penalty. The carbon dioxide purity is high enough to meet most specifications for geological sequestration. Even with carbon capture capability, the power plant has a higher efficiency (4-10 percentage points) than standard pulverized coal or integrated gasification combined cycle processes without carbon capture and consumes significantly less fresh water. If cooling towers are replaced with dry-cooling technology, net water can be produced and recovered, rather than consumed. Moreover, under a cap-and-trade scenario, the process has the lowest cost-of-electricity, even with carbon capture, for carbon prices above $5-10/tonne. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Depositional environments being investigated by the national energy technology laboratory (NETL) for potential geologic storage of CO2;A need exists for further research on carbon sequestration technologies to capture and store carbon dioxide (CO2) from stationary sources that would otherwise be emitted to the atmosphere. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies have the potential to be a key technology for reducing CO 2 emissions and mitigating global climate change. Deploying these technologies on a commercial-scale will require geologic storage formations capable of (1) sequestering large volumes of CO2, (2) receiving CO2 at an efficient and economic rate of injection, and (3) retaining CO2 safely over extended periods. Eleven major types of depositional environments, each having their own unique opportunities and challenges, are being considered by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for CO2 storage. These different classes of reservoirs include deltaic, coal/shale, fluvial, alluvial, strandplain, turbidite, eolian, lacustrine, clastic shelf, carbonate shallow shelf, and reef. Basaltic interflow zones are also being considered as potential reservoirs. DOE has recently completed a study which investigates the geology, geologic reservoir properties and confining units, and geologic depositional systems of potential reservoirs and how enhanced oil recovery and coal bed methane are currently utilizing CO2. It looks at the classes of geologic formations that have been identified as having the potential to be CO2 reservoirs, their distribution and potential storage volumes. This study also discusses the efforts that DOE is supporting to characterize and test small and large scale injections of CO2 into these different classes of reservoirs. These tests are important to better understand the directional tendencies imposed by the depositional environment that may influence how fluids flow within these systems today, and how CO 2 in geologic sequestration is anticipated to flow in the future. Although diagenesis has modified fluid flow paths during the intervening millions of years since they were deposited, the basic architectural framework created during deposition remains. Geologic processes that are working today also existed when the sediments were initially deposited. Analysis of modem day depositional analogs, evaluation of core samples, outcrops and well logs from ancient subsurface formations give an indication of how formations were deposited and how fluid flow within these formations is anticipated to flow.;2010;0;0;
Exergy analysis of the solar thermochemical cycle for capturing CO2 from air;This paper presents exergy analysis of the novel solar thermochemical cycle for CO2 capture from ambient air. The exergy balance, the degree of the thermodynamic perfection, the influence coefficient and the exergy efficiency are determined for every element of the system. The proposed system has rather low exergy efficiency of 4.8%, mainly owing to the primary purpose of this system to capture CO2 from air and not to produce energy. On the basis of exergetic analysis, possible ways of improving system performance are identified: increasing solar collector efficiency, pre-heating methane flow before the reforming reaction, recovering heat of the slaking process.;2010;1;0;
A Very Inconvenient Truth;Studies conducted after those that contributed to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (FAR) suggest that human society may be facing a very inconvenient truth-that emission reduction efforts alone are unlikely to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations at levels low enough to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Here, we discuss reasons why the IPCC process is prone to underestimating the threats of global climate change. We then review some of the critical policy-relevant scientific findings that have emerged since the release of the IPCC FAR. Finally, we discuss how these new findings fundamentally transform the debate on efforts needed to prevent dangerous changes to our climate system. It now appears that to avoid such changes, society will likely need to adopt a mixed strategy of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and employing geoengineering approaches that extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and/or reduce the level of incoming solar radiation reaching Earth's surface.;2010;1;1;overall context
Reversible and robust CO2 capture by equimolar task-specific ionic liquid-superbase mixtures;Integrated sorption systems consisting of 1 : 1 mixtures of an alcohol-functionalized ionic liquid and a superbase were found to be effective for CO2 capture under atmospheric pressure, eliminating the use of volatile n-alkanols or water. Conversely, by using the current approach, there is no longer a requirement for maintaining scrupulously dry conditions. The effect of ionic liquid structure, choice of superbase, their relative ratios, the sorption temperature, and the reaction time on the absorption and release of CO2 were investigated. Our results demonstrate that (i) this integrated ionic liquid-superbase system is capable of rapid and reversible capture of nearly one mole of CO2 per mole of superbase, (ii) the captured CO2 can be readily released by either mild heating or bubbling with an insert gas (N-2, Ar), and (iii) this novel CO2 chemisorption platform can be recycled with minimal loss of activity. This efficient and fully reversible catch-and-release process using non-volatile, task-specific ionic liquids provides an excellent alternative to current CO2 capture technologies, which are based largely around volatile alkanols or alkylamines. Furthermore, our integrated ionic liquid-superbase system can be used as a novel medium for supported liquid membranes, for which they demonstrate both good selectivity and permeability in model CO2/N-2 gas separations.;2010;1;0;
Accurate correlation, structural interpretation, and thermochemistry of equilibrium adsorption isotherms of carbon dioxide in zeolite NaX by means of the GSTA model;Zeolite NaX (commonly known as zeolite 13X) has found wide use in industry for the separation of carbon dioxide from air, methane-containing landfill gas, and flue gases. Capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide has become of utmost importance to mitigate severe environmental problems associated to burning of fossil fuels, such as the greenhouse effect and the consequential warming of global climate. Due to its low energy consumption and ease of operation, the zeolite-13X molecular-sieve pressure-swing adsorption process has become the method of choice for the recovery and capture of carbon dioxide from air and flue gas. Accurate correlation of the equilibrium adsorption isotherms of carbon dioxide in zeolite NaX is required for the reliable modeling and simulation of that process. In this paper, we firstly show that none of the traditional adsorption isotherm models (such as those of Langmuir, Sips, Toth, UNILAN, and Dubinin-Astakhov) is entirely capable of correlating a published set of equilibrium adsorption isotherms of carbon dioxide in zeolite NaX that were measured over a range of eight decades of pressure. A generalized statistical thermodynamic adsorption (GSTA) model, which we had already derived and successfully applied to the adsorption of water vapor in zeolite 3A, is employed in this work to obtain a very accurate correlation of that set of adsorption isotherms of carbon dioxide in zeolite NaX, for the pressure range from 0.2 Pa to 6.4 MPa and in the temperature range from -78 to 150 degrees C. We also provide thermochemical and structural interpretations of the isotherms fit and make predictions for the isosteric heat of adsorption that are in excellent agreement with the available experimental data.

Atmospheric carbon dioxide removal: long-term consequences and commitment;Carbon capture from ambient air has been proposed as a mitigation strategy to counteract anthropogenic climate change. We use an Earth system model to investigate the response of the coupled climate-carbon system to an instantaneous removal of all anthropogenic CO(2) from the atmosphere. In our extreme and idealized simulations, anthropogenic CO(2) emissions are halted and all anthropogenic CO(2) is removed from the atmosphere at year 2050 under the IPCC A2 CO(2) emission scenario when the model-simulated atmospheric CO(2) reaches 511 ppm and surface temperature reaches 1.8 degrees C above the pre-industrial level. In our simulations a one-time removal of all anthropogenic CO(2) in the atmosphere reduces surface air temperature by 0.8 degrees C within a few years, but 1 degrees C surface warming above pre-industrial levels lasts for several centuries. In other words, a one-time removal of 100% excess CO(2) from the atmosphere offsets less than 50% of the warming experienced at the time of removal. To maintain atmospheric CO(2) and temperature at low levels, not only does anthropogenic CO(2) in the atmosphere need to be removed, but anthropogenic CO(2) stored in the ocean and land needs to be removed as well when it outgasses to the atmosphere. In our simulation to maintain atmospheric CO(2) concentrations at pre-industrial levels for centuries, an additional amount of CO(2) equal to the original CO(2) captured would need to be removed over the subsequent 80 years.;2010;1;1;
Sorbents for CO2 capture from flue gas-aspects from materials and theoretical chemistry;Predictions of future climate change have triggered a search for ways to reduce the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) assists this goal by reducing carbon dioxide emissions, and CO2 adsorbents in particular can reduce the costs of CO2 capture. Here, we review the nanoscale sorbent materials that have been developed and the theoretical basis for their function in CO2 separation, particularly from N-2- rich flue gases.;2010;0;0;
Performance Test of an Inertial Fibrous Filter for Ultrafine ParticleCollection and the Possible Sulfate Loss when Using an AluminumSubstrate with Ultrasonic Extraction of Ionic Compounds;"A sampler using inertial fibrous filters (INF) has been recently developed for ultrafine particle collection by impaction and filtration. This new sampler has a low pressure drop (20-30 kPa) and can separate particles smaller than 0.1 mu m with a high sampling flow rate (40 L/min). In this study, sampling performance of the INF sampler was evaluated in comparison with a reference sampler in the field as well as in the laboratory and the possible sulfate ion loss when using aluminum substrates for ion extraction in ultrasonic bath was discovered and investigated. When sampling ultrafine particles (Dp <= 0.1 mu m) such as carbonaceous and ionic species both in the field and in the laboratory, the performance of the INF sampler was similar to that of a reference sampler despite differences of sampling mechanism, cut-point diameter, and substrate proving that the INF sampler can be an alternative for ultrafine particle collection. Underestimation of sulfate concentration appeared to be unavoidable in ultrasonic extractions from aluminum substrates regardless of whether the extraction time was 30 or 90 min. The average sulfate loss during aluminum filter extraction was 45% (+/- 12%; min: 12%; max: 94%). Therefore, ultrasonic extraction from aluminum filters should be avoided to obtain unbiased measurements of sulfate concentration in ambient air or other ion extraction methods should be considered to minimize sulfate loss (dissolution of aluminum ions) from aluminum filters with sufficient extraction efficiency of ionic species.The results of this study indicate that the performance of the INF sampler is almost similar to that of the nano-MOUDI sampler for ultrafine particle collection, while advantageous in terms of convenience, and analysis. Furthermore, the INF sampler can collect amounts of ultrafine particles that are sufficient for chemical analysis in a relatively short time, and the particles can be uniformly collected with a quartz fiber filter.";2010;0;0;
Equimolar CO2 capture by imidazolium-based ionic liquids and superbase systems;Imidazolium-based ionic liquids continue to attract interest in many areas of chemistry because of their low melting points, relatively low viscosities, ease of synthesis, and good stabilities against oxidative and reductive conditions. However, they are not totally inert under many conditions due to the intrinsic acidity of hydrogen at the C-2 position in the imidazolium cation. In this work, this intrinsic acidity was exploited in combination with an organic superbase for the capture of CO2 under atmospheric pressure. During the absorption of CO2, the imidazolium-based ionic liquid containing an equimolar superbase reacted with CO2 to form a liquid carboxylate salt so that the equimolar capture of CO2 with respect to the base was achieved. The effects of ionic liquid structures, types of organic superbases, absorption times, and reaction temperatures on the capture of CO2 were investigated. Our results show that this integrated ionic liquid-superbase system is capable of rapid and reversible capture of about 1 mol CO2 per mole of ionic liquid. Furthermore, the captured CO2 can be readily released by either heating or bubbling N-2, and recycled with little loss of its capture capability. This efficient and reversible catch-and-release process using the weak acidity of the C-2 proton in nonvolatile imidazolium-based ionic liquids provides a good alternative to the current CO2 capture methods that use volatile alkanols, amines, or water.;2010;1;0;
Low energy packed tower and caustic recovery for direct capture of CO2 from air;We used a 6.5 m tall packed tower prototype to study the capturing rate of CO2 from air. The tower was operated at a pressure drop of less than 27 pa in the packing at 0.7 m/sec air speed with a counter current flow mode and with NaOH or KOH solution as the absorbent. The tower consumed an average of ∼30 kJe per mole CO2. We found that via an intermittent operation with a 5% duty cycle, the fluid pumping work reduced by 90%. A novel process for removing carbonates ions from alkaline solutions based on titanate compounds is compared to the traditional lime cycle for the caustic recovery. The titanate process reduces the high-grade heat requirement by ∼50%. The results from experimental data of leaching and precipitation test support process design of the titanate cycle. In this paper, we also present the chemical process design. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2009;1;0;
The Oxy-combustion burner development for the CO2 pilot at Lacq;Steam demand is increasing for Oil & Gas projects, and in particular oil sands and extra-heavy oils thermal recovery schemes. Use of oil residues and bitumen can be a cost-effective solution for natural gas substitution in SAGD (Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage). However, use of such fuels gives rise to higher specific GHG emissions. Oxy-combustion technology is an elegant solution to this problem since oxygen allows complete combustion of very high viscosity and heavy fuels, and because it provides a concentrated CO2 stream, for easier Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). Air Liquide has acquired over the last two decades extensive industrial experience of full oxy-combustion for the glass, metals, cement and waste treatment industries. This expertise and extensive scientific knowledge have been used to develop an innovative oxy-burner technology, specific to steam and power production applications. This oxy-burner technology presents novel and differentiating features, which will be described in this paper. In particular, it features a direct oxygen injection into the burner, without external mixing of oxygen with the flue gas recycle, which provides additional flue gas recycle rate flexibility, and enables a safe handling of the oxygen. Air Liquide has demonstrated the performance of this oxy-burner concept through downscaled (1 MW) oxy- combustion tests in a dedicated cold-wall test-rig with flue gas recycle. Total will retrofit the air-fired boiler at its Lacq CO2 Project (SW of France) with an intermediate size of this oxy- burner technology (four 8 MW oxy-burners). The paper presents: •the innovative oxy-burner technology, its challenges and novelties,•a description of the Air Liquide 1 MW oxy-combustion test rig and the test results obtained over a wide range of flue gas recycle rates,•the integration of the oxy-combustion system into Total's existing 30 MWth boiler. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Climate change: Is there a Plan B?;"According to the UK's Royal Society (RS), the world may have to fall back on little-understood and potentially dangerous ""geoengineering"" techniques to stem global warming if December 2009's climate-change talks fail. An RS study, Geoengineering the climate: Science, governance and uncertainty, says unless future measures to cut greenhouse-gas emissions are much more successful than those taken so far, some little-tested forms of more radical intervention may be needed in the longer term. The most promising of these are Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) and Solar Radiation Management. CDR could take 3 main forms, i.e., capturing CO2 from the ambient air; enhanced weathering, which uses chemical reactions involved in rock weathering to reduce CO2 levels in the air; and increased afforestation to enable more CO2 to be absorbed by vegetation. However, the first two techniques have yet to be shown to be practical or cost effective, while afforestation would create land-use conflicts. The society also investigated ideas such as shields in space to deflect the sun's rays, but said they would be prohibitively expensive at the moment. Meanwhile, China and other developing nations remain reluctant to agree to pay for big cuts in their own emissions to deal with a problem they regard as having been caused mainly by the West.";2009;1;1;
Carbon capture and storage;Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is a technology aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels during industrial and energy-related processes. CCS involves the capture, transport and long-term storage of carbon dioxide, usually in geological reservoirs deep underground that would otherwise be released to the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide capture and storage offers important possibilities for making further use of fossil fuels more compatible with climate change mitigation policies. The largest volumes of CO2 could be captured from large point sources such as from power generation, which alone accounts for about 40 per cent of total anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The development of capture technologies in the power generation sector could be particularly important in view of the projected increase in demand for electricity in fast developing countries with enormous coal reserves (IEA 2002a). Although, this prospect is promising, more research is needed to overcome several hurdles such as important costs of capture technology and the match of large capture sources with adequate geological storage sites. The book will provide a comprehensive, detailed but non-specialist overview of the wide range of technologies involved in carbon dioxide capture and sequestration. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

CO2 capture from atmospheric air via consecutive CaO-carbonation and CaCO3-calcination cycles in a fluidized-bed solar reactor;A thermochemical cyclic process and associated reactor is presented for the continuous removal of CO2 from ambient air via consecutive CaO-carbonation and CaCO3-calcination steps using concentrated solar energy as the source of high-temperature process heat. A fluidized-bed solar reactor is applied to accomplish the carbonation at 365-400 degrees C and the calcination at 800-875 degrees C, with reacting particles directly exposed to high-flux solar irradiation. Water vapor was introduced during the carbonation step to enhance its kinetics. Five consecutive cycles were performed, yielding complete removal of CO2 from a continuous airflow containing 500 ppm of CO2 within a residence time of 1.3 s during each carbonation step, and subsequent complete release of CO2 and regeneration of the CaO reacting particles during the calcination step. The reactor design, set-Lip, and experimentation using a high-flux solar simulator are described. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2009;1;0;
The impact of carbon capture and storage on climate;Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is being widely discussed as a possible mitigation option for limiting the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from fossil fuel burning power plants. The implementation of CCS requires the resolution of a number of difficult policy, engineering and economic issues. Here we address the efficacy of CCS from the perspective of climate science. Implementation of CCS makes power stations less efficient, in the sense that they produce more CO2 for a given output of electricity, a feature which is characterised by the so-called energy penalty. The captured CO2 is then stored in, for example, geological storage reservoirs, from which some small fraction is expected to leak back into the atmosphere each year.We use a set of relatively simple models of carbon capture, the atmospheric carbon cycle and climate, to quantify, for a range of CCS engineering and implementation parameters, the amount of leakage from these reservoirs that can be tolerated to ensure that CCS leads to less, rather than more, climate change. We demonstrate that up to the year 2100, for almost all the parameters that we consider, application of CCS is beneficial. However, in some cases the benefit might be small. We also consider a much longer time horizon (out to the year 2500). We find that while many parameter combinations still lead to a benefit, there are some cases for which application of CCS leads to greater warming than had it not been applied at all. The largest single controlling factor is seen to be the storage reservoir retention time. Many previous studies focused on the use of those storage reservoirs with very long retention times, but we demonstrate that the use of less resilient reservoirs might also provide a climate benefit during the 100 to 500 year time horizon. The largest absolute benefits of CCS to global temperature are found for high future emission scenarios. These absolute benefits also increase as the climate sensitivity of the model is increased.;2009;0;0;
Bio-Ethanol Based Ethylene;The use of bioethanol-based ethylene as raw material for chemical products, especially to produce polyethylene and other polymers, is being considered an effective way to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and offer to the market an alternative of a commodity plastic with a wide range of applications and a low carbon footprint.

An idealized assessment of the economics of air capture of carbon dioxide in mitigation policy;This paper discusses the technology of direct capture of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere called air capture. It develops a simple arithmetic description of the magnitude of the challenge of stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide as a cumulative allocation over the 21st century. This approach, consistent with and based on the work of the intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), sets the stage for an analysis of the average costs of air capture over the 21st century under the assumption that technologies available today are used to fully offset net human emissions of carbon dioxide. The simple assessment finds that even at a relatively high cost per ton of carbon, the costs of air capture are directly comparable to the costs of stabilization using other means as presented by recent reports of the IPCC and the Stern Review Report.

Carbon capture and storage: pulling down the barriers in the European Union;Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is one of the number of approaches to mitigating climate change by reducing the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere. It involves capturing carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions from large point sources such as power plants, prior to compressing, transporting, and storing it securely in geological formations. The CO(2) emitted is thus prevented from entering the atmosphere. CCS is believed, by many, to have massive potential to significantly reduce GHG emissions, with the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggesting that CCS could contribute between 10 and 55 per cent of the world's total carbon mitigation effort until 2100.This article considers the principal impediments to the development of CCS projects and the steps taken in the European Union (EU) to overcome them. The development of CCS requires not only the establishment of adequate funding mechanisms and, most likely, the existence of consistently higher carbon prices than those prevail today, but also the settlement of a number of key legal issues. Although much further work is required on the part of legislators, a regulatory framework for CCS is slowly growing in various jurisdictions, especially in the EU where a large step forward was taken in December 2008 with the passing of a CCS Directive.;2009;0;0;
Low-energy sodium hydroxide recovery for CO2 capture from atmospheric air-Thermodynamic analysis;"To reduce the risks of climate change, atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases must be lowered. Direct capture Of CO2 from ambient air, ""air capture"", might be one of the few methods capable of systematically managing dispersed emissions. The most commonly proposed method for air capture is a wet scrubbing technique which absorbs CO2 in an alkaline absorbent, i.e. sodium hydroxide producing an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate. In most of the previous works it was assumed that the absorbent would be regenerated and CO2 liberated from the alkaline carbonate solution using a lime and calcium carbonate causticization cycle.We describe a novel technique for recovering sodium hydroxide from an aqueous alkaline solution of sodium carbonate and present an end-to-end energy and exergy analysis. In the first step of the recovery process, anhydrous sodium carbonate is separated from the concentrated sodium hydroxide solution using a two-step precipitation and crystallization process. The anhydrous sodium carbonate is then causticized using sodium tri-titanate. The titanate direct causticization process has been of interest for the pulp and paper industry and has been tested at lab- and pilot-scale. In the causticization process, sodium hydroxide is regenerated and carbon dioxide is liberated as a pure stream, which is compressed for use or disposal. The technique requires similar to 50% less high-grade heat than conventional causticization and the maximum temperature required is reduced by at least 50 degrees C. This titanate cycle may allow a substantial reduction in the overall cost of direct air capture. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.";2009;1;0;
Capture of carbon dioxide from ambient air;Carbon dioxide capture from ambient air could compensate for all carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere. Such capture would, for example, make it possible to use liquid, carbon-based fuels in cars or airplanes without negatively impacting the climate. We present a specific approach based on a solid sorbent in the form of an anionic exchange resin, that absorbs carbon dioxide when dry and releases it when exposed to moisture. We outline a particular implementation of such a moisture swing and discuss the scale of the collectors, the energy consumption, and the indirect carbon dioxide emissions related to the operation of carbon dioxide capture devices.;2009;1;0;
Why Capture CO2 from the Atmosphere?;"Air capture is an industrial process for capturing CO2 from ambient air; it is one of an emerging set of technologies for CO2 removal that includes geological storage of biotic carbon and the acceleration of geochemical weathering. Although air capture will cost more than capture from power plants when both are operated under the same economic conditions, air capture allows one to apply industrial economies of scale to small and mobile emission sources and enables a partial decoupling of carbon capture from the energy infrastructure, advantages that may compensate for the intrinsic difficulty of capturing carbon from the air.";2009;1;1;
Carbon fibre composite for ventilation air methane (VAM) capture;Coal mine methane (CMM) is not only a hazardous greenhouse gas but is also a wasted energy resource, if not utilised. This paper evaluates a novel adsorbent material developed for capturing methane from ventilation air methane (VAM) gas in underground coal mines. The adsorbent material is a honeycomb monolithic carbon fibre composite (HMCFC) consisting of multiple parallel flow-through channels and the material exhibits unique features including low pressure drop, good mechanical properties. ability to handle dust-containing gas streams. good thermal and electrical conductivity and selective adsorption of gases. During this study, a series of HMCFC adsorbents (using different types of carbon fibres) were successfully fabricated. Experimental data demonstrated the proof-of-concept of using the HMCFC adsorbent to capture methane from VAM gas. The adsorption capacity of the HMCFC adsorbent was twice that of commercial activated carbon. Methane concentration of 0.56% in the inlet VAM gas stream is reduced to about 0.011% after it passes through the novel carbon fibre composite adsorbent material at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. This amounts to a maximum capture efficiency of 98%. These encouraging laboratory scale studies have prompted further large scale trials and economic assessment. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

CO2 capture from air via CaO-carbonation using a solar-driven fluidized bed reactor-Effect of temperature and water vapor concentration;A two-step thermochemical cyclic process to capture CO2 from atmospheric air via consecutive CaO-carbonation CaCO3-calcination reactions is investigated using concentrated solar energy. A kinetic analysis of the carbonation of CaO with dry and moist air containing 500 ppm CO2 is performed in a fluidized bed solar reactor with particles directly exposed to high-flux thermal irradiation. The CO2 removal capacity was examined in the temperature range 290-390 degrees C and water vapor concentration range 0-17%. Complete CO2 removal was achieved from a continuous flow of moist air at 390 degrees C and residence times of less than 1.5 s, while the extent of CaO-carbonation was almost doubled by the addition of water vapor. Kinetic models that account for consecutive chemically and diffusion-controlled regimes were applied to describe the carbonation rate with dry air, limited initially through interface reactions and later through reactant penetration across the layer of CaCO3 until reaching the unreacted core. In contrast, a chemically-controlled rate law was applied to describe the augmented carbonation rate with moist air, which proceeded through the formation of an interface of water and/or OH ions at the solid surface not covered by CaCO3. The corresponding reaction orders and Arrhenius rate constants were determined by fitting to the experimental data. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;2009;1;0;
Development of Molecular Electrocatalysts for CO2 Reduction and H-2Production/Oxidation;T he conversion of solar energy to fuels in both natural and artificial photosynthesis requires components for both light-harvesting and catalysis. The light-harvesting component generates the electrochemical potentials required to drive fuel-generating reactions that would otherwise be thermodynamically uphill. This Account focuses on work from our laboratories on developing molecular electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction and for hydrogen production.A true analog of natural photosynthesis will require the ability to capture CO2 from the atmosphere and reduce it to a useful fuel. Work in our laboratories has focused on both aspects of this problem. Organic compounds such as quinones and inorganic metal complexes can serve as redox-active CO2 carriers for concentrating CO2. We have developed catalysts for CO2 reduction to form CO based on a [Pd(triphosphine)(solvent)](2+) platform. Catalytic activity requires the presence of a weakly coordinating solvent molecule that can dissociate during the catalytic cycle and provide a vacant coordination site for binding water and assisting C-O bond cleavage. Structures of [NiFe] CO dehydrogenase enzymes and the results of studies on complexes containing two [Pd(triphosphine)(solvent)](2+) units suggest that participation of a second metal in CO2 binding may also be required for achieving very active catalysts.We also describe molecular electrocatalysts for H-2 production and oxidation based on [Ni(diphosphine)(2)](2+) complexes. Similar to palladium CO2 reduction catalysts, these species require the optimization of both first and second coordination spheres. In this case, we use structural features of the first coordination sphere to optimize the hydride acceptor ability of nickel needed to achieve heterolytic cleavage of H-2. We use the second coordination sphere to incorporate pendant bases that assist in a number of important functions including H-2 binding, H-2 cleavage, and the transfer of protons between nickel and solution. These pendant bases, or proton relays, are likely to be important in the design of catalysts for a wide range of fuel production and fuel utilization reactions involving multiple electron and proton transfer steps.The generation of fuels from abundant substrates such as CO2 and water remains a daunting research challenge, requiring significant advances in new inexpensive materials for light harvesting and the development of fast, stable, and efficient electrocatalysts. Although we describe progress in the development of redox-active carriers capable of concentrating CO2 and molecular electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction, hydrogen production, and hydrogen oxidation, much more remains to be done.;2009;1;0;
CO2 capture from atmospheric air via carbonation-calcination cycle;A thermochemical cyclic process and associated apparatus for the removal of CO2 from ambient air is presented based on carbonation-calcination steps using concentrated solar energy as the source of high-temperature process heat. Closed material cycles based on CaO, MgO, and Na2CO3 as sorbents are thermodynamically and kinetically examined. A laboratory-scale tubular quartz reactor containing a fluidized bed is applied to accomplish the carbonation of CaO at 375° and calcination of CaCO3 at above 800°, with reacting particles directly exposed to high-flux solar irradiation. Water vapor was introduced during the carbonation step to enhance its kinetics. A cyclic process is performed, yielding 100% uptake of CO2 from air and its release as pure CO2 at 1 bar. The reactor set-up and experimental run are described.;2008;1;0;
Steam gasification of coal at low-medium (600-800 degrees C) temperature with simultaneous CO2 capture in a bubbling fluidized bed at atmospheric pressure. 2. Results and recommendations for scaling up;A gasification gas with an H-2 content as high as 80 vol %, dry basis has been obtained by gasification of coal with pure steam at 600-800 degrees C. The gasifier used was an atmospheric and bubbling fluidized bed operating with CaO in the bed as the CO2 sorbent. The research was carried out at a small pilot plant scale with continuous feeding of coal and batch mode introduction of the CaO. The gas composition and gas quality (tar content) is given for the following variables of operation: (a) type of in-bed sorbent used, (b) the amount of CaO in the bed related to the amount of coal fed, (c) temperature in the gasifier bed, (d) weight hourly space velocity (h(-1)) of the coal in the gasifier, and (e) time(-on-stream). To capture CaO at atmospheric pressure, the gasification with in-bed CaO had to be carried out at low-medium (600-800 degrees C) gasification temperatures. For this reason, the tar content in the gasification gas was high (up to 52 g/Nm(3)), which lowered the value of the H-2-rich gasification raw gas. It is demonstrated that a gas rich in H-2 (80 Vol % H2, dry basis), and with very low CO2 and tar contents, can be obtained only if the coal gasification, at atmospheric pressure and with pure steam, is carried out at [CaO/coal] ratios above 10-15.;2008;1;0;
Carbon dioxide capture from atmospheric air using sodium hydroxide spray;"In contrast to conventional carbon capture systems for power plants and other large point sources, the system described in this paper captures CO2 directly from ambient air. This has the advantages that emissions from diffuse sources and past emissions may be captured. The objective of this research is to determine the feasibility of a NaOH spray-based contactor for use in an air capture system by estimating the cost and energy requirements per unit CO2 captured. A prototype system is constructed and tested to measure CO2 absorption, energy use, and evaporative water loss and compared with theoretical predictions. A numerical model of drop collision and coalescence is used to estimate operating parameters for a full-scale system, and the cost of operating the system per unit CO2 captured is estimated. The analysis indicates that CO2 capture from air for climate change mitigation is technically feasible using off-the-shelf technology. Drop coalescence significantly decreases the CO2 absorption efficiency; however, fan and pump energy requirements are manageable. Water loss is significant (20 mol H2O/mol CO2 at 15 degrees C and 65% RH) but can be lowered by appropriately designing and operating the system. The cost of CO2 capture using NaOH spray (excluding solution recovery and CO2 sequestration, which may be comparable) in the full-scale system is 96 $/ton-CO2 in the base case, and ranges from 53 to 127 $/ton-CO2 under alternate operating parameters and assumptions regarding capital costs and mass transfer rate. The low end of the cost range is reached by a spray with 50 mu m mean drop diameter, which is achievable with commercially available spray nozzles.";2008;1;0;
Soil organic phosphorus in tropical forests: an assessment of theNaOH-EDTA extraction procedure for quantitative analysis by solution(31)P NMR spectroscopy;The extraction of soil organic phosphorus by the NaOH-EDTA procedure was assessed in detail for a tropical forest soil (clay-loam, pH 4.3, total carbon 2.7%). Optimum conditions for the quantification of soil organic phosphorus and characterization of its composition by solution (31)P NMR spectroscopy were extraction in a solution containing 0.25 M NaOH and 50 mM Na(2)EDTA in a 1:20 solid to solution ratio for 4 hours at ambient laboratory temperature. Replicate analyses yielded a coefficient of variation of 3% for organic phosphorus as a proportion of the spectral area. There was no significant difference in total phosphorus extraction from fresh and air-dried soil, although slightly more organic phosphorus and less paramagnetic ions were extracted from dried soil. The procedure was not improved by changing the concentration of NaOH or EDTA, extraction time, or solid to solution ratio. Pre-extraction with HCl or Na(2)EDTA did not increase subsequent organic phosphorus extraction in NaOH-EDTA or improve spectral resolution in solution (31)P NMR spectroscopy. Post-extraction treatment with Chelex resin did not improve spectral resolution, but removed small concentrations of phosphorus from the extracts. Increasing the pH of NaOH-EDTA extracts (up to 1.0 M NaOH) increased the concentration of phosphate monoesters, but decreased DNA to an undetectable level, indicating its hydrolysis in strong alkali. The standardized NaOH-EDTA extraction procedure is therefore recommended for the analysis of organic phosphorus in tropical forest soils.;2008;0;0;
Conceptual study of distributed CO2 capture and the sustainable carbon economy;Capture of carbon dioxide from distributed sources is often neglected as a viable solution to the global problem of CO2 emissions management. Small scale power plants, including those applicable to the transportation sector, can be designed to capture their CO2 exhaust stream, provided it is not heavily diluted with air. Liquefaction of carbon dioxide allows the captured CO2 to be stored densely, with a minimal energetic penalty and space requirement, until it can be permanently sequestered. In this short-term solution, the energetic penalty for CO2 capture can be further offset by exploiting novel energy conversion processes involving regeneration of the reaction product stream - a simple strategy that is not exploited in conventional systems. More importantly, in the long-term, as the renewable energy infrastructure is built up, the collected CO2 can be recycled into synthetic carbon-based liquid fuels which act as energy carriers in the sustainable carbon economy.

Feasibility of Na-based thermochemical cycles for the capture of CO2 from air - Thermodynamic and thermogravimetric analyses;Three Na-based thermochemical cycles for capturing CO2 from air are considered: (1) a NaOH/NaHCO3/Na2CO3/Na2O cycle with 4 reaction steps, (2) a NaOH/NaHCO3/Na2CO3 cycle with 3 reactions steps, and (3) a Na2CO3/NaHCO3 cycle with 2 reaction steps. Depending on the choice of CO2 sorbent - NaOH or Na2CO3 - the cycles are closed by either NaHCO3 or Na2CO3 decomposition, followed by hydrolysis of Na2CO3 or Na2O, respectively. The temperature requirements, energy inputs, and expected products of the reaction steps were determined by thermodynamic equilibrium and energy balance computations. The total thermal energy requirement for Cycles 1, 2, and 3 are 481, 213, and 390 kJ/mol of CO2 captured, respectively, when heat exchangers are employed to recover the sensible heat of hot streams. Isothermal and dynamic thermogravi metric runs were carried out on the pertinent carbonation, decomposition, and hydrolysis reactions. The extent of the NaOH carbonation with 500 ppm CO2 in air at 25 degrees C - applied in Cycles 1 and 2 - reached 9% after 4 h, while that for the Na2CO3 carbonation with water-saturated air - applied in Cycle 3 - was 3.5% after 2 h. Thermal decomposition of NaHCO3 - applied in all three cycles - reached completion after 3 min in the 90-200 degrees C range, while that of Na2CO3 - applied in Cycle I - reached completion after 15 min in the 1000-1400 degrees C range. The significantly slow reaction rates for the carbonation steps and, consequently, the relatively large mass flow rates required, introduce process complications in the scale-up of the reactor technology and impede the application of Na-based sorbents for capturing CO2 from air.

Ca-based sorbent looping combustion for CO2 capture in pilot-scale dual fluidized beds;To demonstrate process feasibility of in situ CO2 capture from combustion of fossil fuels using Ca-based sorbent looping technology, a flexible atmospheric dual fluidized bed combustion system has been constructed. Both reactors have an ID of 100 mm and can be operated at up to 1000 degrees C at atmospheric pressure. This paper presents preliminary results for a variety of operating conditions, including sorbent looping rate, flue gas stream volume, CaO/CO2 ratio and combustion mode for supplying heat to the sorbent regenerator, including oxy-fuel combustion of biomass and coal with flue gas recirculation to achieve high-concentration CO2 in the off-gas. It is the authors' belief that this study is the first demonstration of this technology using a pilot-scale dual fluidized bed system, with continuous sorbent looping for in situ CO2 capture, albeit at atmospheric pressure. A multicycle test was conducted and a high CO2 capture efficiency (>90%) was achieved for the first several cycles, which decreased to a still acceptable level (>75%) even after more than 25 cycles. The cyclic sorbent was sampled on-line and showed general agreement with the features observed using a lab-scale thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) apparatus. CO2 capture efficiency decreased with increasing number of sorbent looping cycles as expected, and sorbent attrition was found to be another significant factor to be limiting sorbent performance.

Carbon dioxide sequestration. The Total company launches its first French carbon dioxide sequestration industrial project in partnership with the Air Liquide company;The 60 million euro pilot facility to capture and store carbon dioxide underground at the Lacq field announced at the end of 2005 takes shape. The project will be in partnership with the Air Liquide company and public groups such as IFP. The former natural gas field at Rousse, 30 km from the Lacq site, will become the underground reservoir. It is expected to be able to store 150,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide injected over two years starting in November 2008. To obtain the carbon dioxide, the oxy combustion process will be used in which the combustibles will be burned with oxygen not air, eliminating the introduction of nitrogen to the process, facilitating the capture of carbon dioxide. Air Liquide will provide the technology needed to install this process because the absence of the 80% of nitrogen in the air changes the combustion chemistry. The carbon dioxide will be compressed and delivered by pipeline to Rousse and sent to a depth of 4,500 m in an existing well. According to the European Energy Agency (EEA) the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is expected to double to 55 gigatonnes in 2060 if the emissions continue at the present rate and developing countries continue to increase their use of energy. The stakes are high in terms of technologies involved in developing countries that have coal power plants and involved in Europe that is expected to renew its power plant facilities in 20 yr.;2007;0;0;
Kinetic analysis of the carbonation reactions for the capture of CO2 from air via the Ca(OH)(2)-CaCO3-CaO solar thermochemical cycle;A thermogravimetric analysis of the carbonation of CaO and Ca(OH)(2) with 500 ppm CO2 in air at 200-450 degrees C is performed as part of a three-step thermochemical cycle to capture CO2 from air using concentrating solar energy. The rate of CaO-carbonation is fitted to an unreacted core kinetic model that encompasses intrinsic chemical reaction followed by intra-particle diffusion. In contrast, the Ca(OH)(2)-carbonation is less hindered by diffusion while catalyzed by water formation, and its rate is fitted to a chemically-controlled kinetic model at the solid interface not covered by CaCO3. The rates of both carbonation reactions increase with temperature, peak at 400-450 degrees C, and decrease above 450 degrees C as a result of the thermodynamically favored reverse CaCO3-decomposition. Avrami's empirical rate law is applied to describe the CO2 uptake from the continuous air flow by CaO and Ca(OH)(2), with and without added water. The addition of water vapor significantly enhances the reaction kinetics to the extent that, in the first 20 min, the reaction proceeds at a rate that is 22 and nine times faster than that observed for the dry carbonation of CaO and Ca(OH)(2), respectively.

Regeneration of sintered limestone sorbents for the sequestration of CO2 from combustion and other systems;The capacity of particles of CaO, produced by calcining limestone, to reactively absorb CO2, degrades with the number of cycles of carbonation and calcination. A novel method of reactivating the stone in humid, ambient air is described. Typically, a calcined limestone has a carrying capacity for CO2 which falls fromy similar to 79% (on the basis of moles of CO2 permole of CaO) to only about 20-30% after 30 cycles of regeneration and reuse. This new technique enables the carrying capacity to be restored to similar to 55%, thereby improving the economics of sequestrating CO2 using a calcium-based sorbent.;2007;0;0;
Long term climate implications of 2050 emission reduction targets;A coupled atmosphere-ocean-carbon cycle model is used to examine the long term climate implications of various 2050 greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. All emission targets considered with less than 60% global reduction by 2050 break the 2.0 degrees C threshold warming this century, a number that some have argued represents an upper bound on manageable climate warming. Even when emissions are stabilized at 90% below present levels at 2050, this 2.0 degrees C threshold is eventually broken. Our results suggest that if a 2.0 degrees C warming is to be avoided, direct CO2 capture from the air, together with subsequent sequestration, would eventually have to be introduced in addition to sustained 90% global carbon emissions reductions by 2050.;2007;1;1;
Energy and material balance of CO2 capture from ambient air;"Current Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies focus on large, stationary sources that produce approximately 50% of global CO2 emissions. We propose an industrial technology that captures CO2 directly from ambient air to target the remaining emissions. First, a wet scrubbing technique absorbs CO2 into a sodium hydroxide solution. The resultant carbonate is transferred from sodium ions to calcium ions via causticization. The captured CO2 is released from the calcium carbonate through thermal calcination in a modified kiln. The energy consumption is calculated as 350 kJ/mol of CO2 captured. It is dominated by the thermal energy demand of the kiln and the mechanical power required for air movement. The low concentration Of CO2 in air requires a throughput of 3 million cubic meters of air per ton of CO2 removed, which could result in significant water losses. Electricity consumption in the process results in CO2 emissions and the use of coal power would significantly reduce to net amount captured. The thermodynamic efficiency of this process is low but comparable to other ""end of pipe"" capture technologies. As another carbon mitigation technology, air capture could allow for the continued use of liquid hydrocarbon fuels in the transportation sector.";2007;1;0;
Quantity and spectroscopic properties of soil dissolved organic matter(DOM) as a function of soil sample treatments: Air-drying andpre-incubation;The dissolved organic matter (DOM) in soils is essentially defined by the way in which it is obtained. Therefore, we need to understand as to how pre-treatment of a soil will affect the characteristics of DOM, since this fraction may be strongly influenced by a soil's water content. The effect of two different pre-treatments on DOM from the A-horizons of a large variety of ecosystems and regions were compared. In both cases the soils were allowed to air-dry. In one case the air-dried soil was directly extracted (AD), while in the other case it was pre-incubated for I week at 50% of its water holding capacity (INCU). AD is simpler, but INCU brings the soil, and especially its microbial population, back to a standardised state, which is more representative of the Usual state in the field. Both methods are used whenever an adjustment of the soil water content is essential to compare different regions or to eliminate short term weather effects. A significant regression indicated that the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) extracted from INCU samples was only 20% of AD DOC. Both the absorptivity (UV absorption divided by DOC) of 86% of the samples, and a fluorescence emission spectrum based Humification Index in all cases increased as a result of pre-incubation. This would indicate that labile compounds released during drying were metabolised during the incubation. However, the magnitude of this increase varied, and no correlation with soil organic and microbial carbon, pH, or texture could be detected. The results show that DOM extracted from AD and INCU soils is not comparable and that the differences are mainly due to the impact of air-drying on the microbial activity. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Photochemical oxidation of thiophene by air in oil/water two-phase extraction system;Photochemical oxidation of thiophene in n-octane/water extraction system by using air as oxidant was studied. Results obtained here can be used as the reference of oxidative desulfurization of gasoline because thiophene is one of the main sulfur-containing components in fluid catalytic cracking gasoline. A 500 W high pressure Hg lamp (wave length 365 nm, 0.19 kW·m-2) was used as the light source for irradiation and air was introduced by a gas pump for supplying O2. Thiophene dissolved in w-octane was photodecomposed and removed into the water phase at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. Thiophene can be photo-oxidized directly to sulfone, sulfoxide, or ethanedioic acid, SO4 2-, CO2. The photo-oxidation kinetics of thiophene with O2 was first-order with rate constant of 4.42 × 10-5 s-1 and half-time of 4.36 h. The desulfurization yield of thiophene in w-octane was 58.9% for a 5 h photo-irradiation under the conditions with air flow at 150 ml·min-1 and water/oil ratio at 1:1. The sulfur content could be reduced from 800 μl·L-1 to less than 330 μl·L-1.;2006;0;0;
Lower cost of carbon capture gives IGCC big edge over PC;Coal-based IGCC technologies has a big advantage over pulverized coal (PC) plant due to lower cost of carbon capture. More gasification and gas turbine economies will help IGCC to capitalize on its emissions and carbon capture advantages and compete more effectively against PC plants on cost and performance basis. Increasing interest among environmentalists, regulators and utilities in carbon dioxide removal is also having a positive influence on how they evaluate he competitive importance of IGCCb for future coal-based power generation. Gas turbines that enable air extraction across a broader ambient temperature range and when operating with hydrogen firing will make the IGCC technologies more attraction. Inlet air chillers should be used at higher ambient in order to assure that the investment in full-load gasification plant facility can fully utilized over the ambient range.;2006;0;0;
Power systems development facility update on six trig studies;The pursuit of more cost-effective and reliable coal technologies with superior environmental performance continues to drive the development of the Transport Gasifier at the Power Systems Development Facility (PSDF). This paper presents the results of six updated system and economic studies of Transport Integrated Gasification (TrIG) plants. Southern Company and Kellogg Brown and Root (KBR), in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and other partners, are developing the TrIG process at the PSDF for commercial application in the power industry. The PSDF is an engineering scale demonstration of the KBR Transport Gasifier along with a high-temperature, high-pressure syngas filter, a gas cleanup process, and related systems. Built at a sufficient scale to test advanced power systems and components in an integrated fashion, the PSDF provides data necessary for commercial scale-up of these technologies. To guide future tests and commercialization of the technologies at the PSDF, a series of conceptual commercial plant designs has been completed in partnership with the DOE and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). Six TrIG combined cycle cases ha been developed to investigate the relative costs and benefits of oxygen-blown or air-blown gasification, of stack gas or syngas cleanup, and of carbon dioxide capture. These cases are all based on a 2×1 GE7FA+e combined cycle fueled by syngas from two Transport Gasifiers using Powder River Basin (PRB) sub-bituminous coal. Detailed performance modeling and cost estimation have shown that the optimal configuration for power production without carbon dioxide capture includes air-blown gasification and cold syngas cleanup. Airblown gasification was also shown to be preferable when carbon dioxide is captured in a TrIG combined cycle system.;2006;0;0;
Climate strategy with CO2 capture from the air;"It is physically possible to capture CO2 directly from the air and immobilize it in geological structures. Air capture differs from conventional mitigation in three key aspects. First, it removes emissions from any part of the economy with equal ease or difficulty, so its cost provides an absolute cap on the cost of mitigation. Second, it permits reduction in concentrations faster than the natural carbon cycle: the effects of irreversibility are thus partly alleviated. Third, because it is weakly coupled to existing energy infrastructure, air capture may offer stronger economies of scale and smaller adjustment costs than the more conventional mitigation technologies.We assess the ultimate physical limits on the amount of energy and land required for air capture and describe two systems that might achieve air capture at prices under 200 and 500 $/tC using current technology.Like geoengineering, air capture limits the cost of a worst-case climate scenario. In an optimal sequential decision framework with uncertainty, existence of air capture decreases the need for near-term precautionary abatement. The long-term effect is the opposite; assuming that marginal costs of mitigation decrease with time while marginal climate change damages increase, then air capture increases long-run abatement. Air capture produces an environmental Kuznets curve, in which concentrations are returned to preindustrial levels.";2006;1;1;
CO2 capture from air and co-production of H-2 via the Ca(OH)(2)-CaCO3 cycle using concentrated solar power - Thermodynamic analysis;"The thermodynamics of a solar thermochemical cycle for the capture Of CO2 from air are analyzed. The cycle encompasses 3 reactors: an aerosol-type carbonator for capturing CO2 from air using a spray of Ca(OH)(2) aqueous solution, a solar calciner for thermally decomposing CaCO3 into CaO using concentrated solar energy, and a conventional slaker for regenerating Ca(OH)(2). Two approaches are examined: (1) a closed-material cycle that delivers pure CO2; and (2) an open-material cycle that, additionally, co-produces hydrogen. The 2nd approach features the same components as those of the closed-material cycle, except that the calciner co-produces CaO and syngas by the combined CaCO3-decomposion and CH4-reforming processes, and syngas is further processed to separate streams of H-2 and CO2. Its thermodynamic efficiency, defined as the ratio of Delta G degrees(298K)vertical bar(H2+0,.05 -> H2O) for the H-2 produced to the thermal energy input (solar energy+ heating value of CH4) is 22.7%. The Solar chemical reactor technology for the calcination and for the combined calcination-reforming is presented. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.";2006;1;0;
Process design and energy requirements for the capture of carbon dioxide from air;A process to capture carbon dioxide from air to reduce its atmospheric concentration and to mitigate climate change is studied. It is based on the absorption of carbon dioxide in a sodium hydroxide solution, its precipitation as calcium carbonate, and its release as pure gas stream through oxy-fuel calcination. The process utilizes existing commercial technologies wherever possible, particularly in the case of the absorber, whose design is carried out in detail. The analysis allows deriving material and energy balances for the whole process and determining energy demands that can be used for a technical, economical, and environmental feasibility evaluation of the technology. In particular, it indicates that the real specific energy demand is larger than the heat released to emit the same amount of CO2 by the combustion of coal, and smaller than that of methane.

Oxygen efficiency with regard to carbon capture;"Carbon capture is often discussed in the literature with the sole focus on power processes, despite the fact that carbon dioxide emissions from other sources are just as relevant for the impact on the atmosphere. Furthermore, some carbon capture methods are relatively inefficient when applied to power production processes. Carbon capture should preferably be performed where the cost is as low as possible, i.e. not necessarily from power production processes. As an example, carbon capture using combustion with pure oxygen is far more energy efficient if it is used together with lime kilns or cement kilns than together with power production processes. A new concept termed ""oxygen efficiency"" is introduced in this paper. It describes the amount of carbon dioxide that can potentially be captured per unit of oxygen. As such, the oxygen efficiency quantifies the value of a certain unit of oxygen for carbon capture reasons. The base concept is that the energy penalty for the production of one part of oxygen is the same no matter where it is produced; hence, if this unit of oxygen can be used to capture more carbon dioxide, it is more efficient. Typically, the oxygen efficiency would be five times greater for carbon capture when utilising pure oxygen together with cement kilns rather than together with methane-fired power plants. Furthermore, the concept of oxygen efficiency illustrates the importance of considering how carbon capture methods can be utilised in the most efficient way, in addition to evaluating which carbon capture method is the most suitable for a particular technology.

Air extraction;Any technology that can extract CO2 directly from the atmosphere would be advantageous for mitigating CO2 emissions. Air extraction is such a technology that produces a stream of concentrated CO2 ready for sequestration. Air extraction also enables CO2 trading by capturing CO2 anywhere, anytime, and from any emitter. It is a standalone technology that can be mixed with other capture schemes allowing separate optimization of energy conversion as well as CO2 capture and storage. It is well suited for distributed and/or mobile sources, existing infrastructure ill-suited for retrofit, handling leakage from storage sites, challenging CO2 transport scenarios, and driving capture to or above 100%. This chapter presents an overview of air extraction and discusses a study on the Na+/Ca2+ process, which is one specific implementation of air extraction. The air extraction process is based on four chemical reactions: absorption, causticization, calcinations, and slaking. The design examined in the chapter uses readily available sorbents in the form of Trona for sodium and limestone for calcium, and commercially available technologies. The system poses many advantages over retrofit capture schemes and it is felt that it can be improved further through site specific optimization. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2005;1;0;
Using CaO- and MgO-rich industrial waste streams for carbon sequestration;"To prevent rapid climate change, it will be necessary to reduce net anthropogertic CO2 emissions drastically. This likely will require imposition of a tax or tradable permit scheme that creates a subsidy for negative emissions. Here, we examine possible niche markets in the cement and steel Industries where it is possible to generate a limited supply of negative emissions (carbon storage or sequestration) cost-effectively.Ca(OH)(2) and CaO from steel slag or concrete waste can be dissolved in water and reacted with CO2 in ambient air to capture and store carbon safely and permanently in the form of stable carbonate minerals (CaCO3). The kinetics of Ca dissolution for various particle size fractions of ground steel slag and concrete were measured in batch experiments. The majority of available Ca was found to dissolve on a time scale of hours, which was taken to be sufficiently fast for use in an industrial process.An overview of the management options for steel slag and concrete waste is presented, which indicates how their use for carbon sequestration might be integrated into existing industrial processes. Use of the materials in a carbon sequestration scheme does not preclude subsequent use and is likely to add value by removing the undesirable qualities of water absorption and expansion from the products.Finally, an example scheme is presented which could be built and operated with current technology; to sequester CO, with steel slag or concrete waste. Numerical models and simple calculations are used to establish the feasibility and estimate the operating parameters of the scheme. The operating cost is estimated to be US$8/t-CO2 sequestered. The scheme would be important as an early application of technology for capturing CO, directly from ambient air. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.";2005;0;0;
First example of atmospheric carbon dioxide uptake by a cyanocomplex: Preparation and structural characterization of Zn-2(tn)(2)(CO3)Ni(CN)(4) center dot H2O(tn=1,3-diaminopropane);The aqueous system Zn(II)-tn-[Ni(CN)(4)](2)- in contact with air captured carbon dioxide in the form of a carbonato ligand yielded the compound Zn-2(tn)(2)(CO3)Ni(CN)(4) center dot H2O by crystallization, which was characterized by elemental analyses, IR spectroscopy and single crystal structure analysis. Its crystal structure is polymeric and is built up of a positively charged framework [Zn-4(tn)(4)(CO3)(2)Ni(CN)(4)](n)(2n+), free tetracyanonickellate anions with a nickel atom on the inversion centre and water molecules of crystallization. Two crystallographically different zinc atoms exhibit tetrahedral and penta-coordinations. The zinc atoms are interconnected by two crystallographically independent bridging tn ligands, mu(3)-CO32- carbonato ligand and one centrosymmetric tetracyanonickellate anion acting as trans-[-NC-Ni(CN)(2)-CN-] ligand. The carbonato ligand coordinates three zinc atoms by an unusual mode, two by an unidentate and one by a bidentate fashion with one oxygen donor atom forming two Zn-O coordination bonds.

LC-MS/MS determination of naringin, hesperidin and neohesperidin in rat serum after orally administrating the decoction of Bulpleurum falcatum L. and Fractus aurantii;To identify and quantify biologically active components in rat serum after orally administrating the decoction of Bulpleurum falcatum L. and Fractus aurantii, one of traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated. The HPLC separation was carried out on a Waters Nova Pak C 18 column using acetonitrile and water as mobile phase after the sample of rat serum was cleaned up with solid-phase extraction. Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization in the negative ion mode and selected reaction monitoring (SRM) method was developed to determine the active components. Three flavonoids of hesperidin, neohesperidin and naringin were identified in the serum by comparing their retention times and three independent SRM precursor/product ion transitions with those of corresponding reference standards. The concentrations of naringin, hesperidin and neohesperidin in rat serum determined by SRM measurement were 16.3, 11.9 and 14.3ng/ml, respectively, after orally administrating the decoction of B. falcatum L. and F. aurantii. This method was validated in terms of recovery, linearity, accuracy and precision (intra- and interday variation). The recoveries from spiked control samples were 93.0, 89.3 and 91.2% for hesperidin, neohesperidin and naringin, respectively. Linearity in rat serum was observed over the range of 2.0-50.0ng/ml. Percent bias (accuracy) and precision were well within the acceptable range and the relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) of the measured rat serum samples was less than 10% (n=5). © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Carbon dioxide extraction from the atmosphere;The cost of a large-scale facility designed specifically to extract CO2 directly from the atmosphere is estimated. Given the assumptions made, air extraction is expected to be competitive with the CO2 capture technologies currently being proposed. It is unlikely that retrofitting existing power plants will result in 100% CO2 recovery. For the system proposed, the cost of methane is significant. Thus, buying methane from the open market may be prohibitive and other fuels or stranded gas would be better sources. The system is scaled to 1 ton/hr and any increase in size would likely result in cost savings. The costs of mixed oxide membranes, other indirect heating systems or a solid oxide fuel cell is significant and carry large amounts of uncertainty, as these technologies have not reached maturity. As these systems reach maturity, better estimates of their performance and lower production costs can be expected. This is an abstract of a paper presented at the 2004 International Gas Research Conference (Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada 11/1-4/2004).;2004;1;1;
CO2 extraction from ambient air using alkali-metal hydroxide solutions: Niche markets to industrial scale implementation;"CO2 extraction from ambient air using alkali-metal hydroxide solutions was studied. A high-quality estimate of the cost of operation of the contacting unit, in dollars per ton of CO2 captured, was developed that can be used in the cost-accounting of the entire system. Concentrations of captured CO2 that approached or exceeded 1 M were predicted for drops smaller than ∼ 1 mm. The energy required to move air through the contactor was estimated to be small in comparison. For drop sizes &lt; 1 mm or so, the energy requirements were quite modest, &lt; 1 kJ/mole CO2 for the smallest drops, which compares favorably with the heat of combustion of gasoline at 680 kJ/mole CO2. This was also small compared to the preliminary estimates of the energy requirements of the total system (primarily the calciner), which might amount to 220 kJ/mole CO2.";2004;1;0;
Evaluation of a novel carbon-based adsorbent material for controlling mercury in gas emissions;The Gas Technology Institute (GTI) formed a partnership with the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) to evaluate the performance of a novel carbon-based adsorbent material (catalyst) to capture mercury from gas emissions. GTI/IIT team has successfully conducted initial tests to determine technical feasibility and capacity of this adsorbent material. Preliminary results suggest removal (nearly 100%) of mercury from gases due to amalgamation process enhanced by the presence of gold particles in the adsorbent. The observed removal capacity of this adsorbent material, for ambient air conditions, is 10 fold higher than Sorbonorite, a microporous commercial carbon that has shown strong affinity for removal of gaseous pollutants. The adsorption was stable and there was no evidence of desorption.;2004;0;0;
Microwave single vessel acid-vapor extraction: Effect of experimentalparameters on Co and Fe determination in biological samples;Characteristic parameters of a single vessel procedure were investigated for Co and Fe determination in biological samples using nitric acid-vapor extraction under atmospheric pressure. A laboratory-made PTFE support vessel suitable for four cups containing the samples was adapted to fit on the microwave glass vessel. Biological samples (30 mg) were weighed directly into these PTFE cups and exposed to nitric acid vapor stemming from 15 mL concentrated HNO3 placed in the bottom of the glass vessel. Sample cups were positioned at 50, 80, 110, and 140 mm from the support base. We evaluated the temperature, acidity, and residual carbon content of each sample cup, i.e. parameters that could influence the efficiency of vapor-phase acid digestion. The influence of sample particle size on digestion efficiency was also considered. It was demonstrated that temperature was the main parameter for efficient recovery of both Co and Fe in biological samples, and higher temperatures allowed lower residual carbon contents.;2004;0;0;
Improved long-term conversion of limestone-derived sorbents for in situ capture of CO2 in a fluidized bed combustor;Cyclic carbonation and calcination reactions were investigated for capturing CO2 from combustion and gasification processes. Sorbent particles in the size range 600-1400 mum were subjected to multiple capture cycles at atmospheric pressure to obtain a surface mapping of conversion based on calcination and carbonation temperatures. Steam hydration of CaO was utilized to increase both pore area and pore volume to improve long-term conversion to CaCO3 over multiple cycles. The steam hydration improved the long-term performance of the sorbent, resulting in directly measured conversions as high as 52% and estimated conversions as high as 59% after up to 20 cycles. It is estimated that the increase in conversion has improved the economics of the proposed process to the point where commercialization is attractive. It has been shown that when carbonating in the temperature range from 700 to 740 degreesC, calcination temperatures from 700 to 900 degreesC can be used without seriously reducing the conversion of CaO for CO2 capture over multiple cycles. Processes based on this approach are expected to be able to reduce CO2 emissions from coal- and petroleum coke-fired fluidized bed combustors by up to 85%, while avoiding excessive sorbent replacement.;2004;0;0;
Disposal in the sea of carbon dioxide released from power stations;"Substantial amounts of flue gases are released into the atmosphere from industries and power plants fired either by coal or gas. The present study concerns the possibility of preventing CO2 emissions from gas-fired power stations located in Brunei Darussalam from polluting the atmosphere. After extraction from the emission, the gas can be compressed and dissolved into seawater, which increases the density of the solution (seawater plus compressed CO2). The solution can be injected in the sea where it would be transported by currents to deep water that provides a retention time of hundreds of years. In this study, the disposal of CO2 in seawater is simulated using two computer packages CORMIX 1 &amp; 2. Two different options (single and multiple ports) are considered. Optimum configurations for the disposal of CO2 into the sea for different ambient velocities are found. Preliminary results demonstrate that the maximum concentration of the effluent can be reduced with these configurations in near as well as in far-field regions. 2003 WIT Press. © 2003 WIT Press.";2003;0;0;
Separation and capture of CO2 from large stationary in sources and sequestration in geological formations;;2003;0;0;
Separation and capture of CO2 from large stationary sources and sequestration in geological formations - Coalbeds and deep saline aquifers;The topic of global warming as a result of increased atmospheric CO2 concentration is arguably the most important environmental issue that the world faces today. It is a global problem that will need to be solved on a global level. The link between anthropogenic emissions of CO2 with increased atmospheric CO2 levels and, in turn, with increased global temperatures has been well established and accepted by the world. International organizations such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have been formed to address this issue. Three options are being explored to stabilize atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and global temperatures without severely and negatively impacting standard of living: (1) increasing energy efficiency, (2) switching to less carbon-intensive sources of energy, and (3) carbon sequestration. To be successful, all three options must be used in concert. The third option is the subject of this review. Specifically, this review will cover the capture and geologic sequestration of CO2 generated from large point sources, namely fossil-fuel-fired power gasification plants. Sequestration of CO2 in geological formations is necessary to meet the President's Global Climate Change Initiative target of an 18% reduction in GHG intensity by 2012. Further, the best strategy to stabilize the atmospheric concentration of CO2 results from a multifaceted approach where sequestration of CO2 into geological formations is combined with increased efficiency in electric power generation and utilization, increased conservation, increased use of lower carbon-intensity fuels, and increased use of nuclear energy and renewables.This review covers the separation and capture of CO2 from both flue gas and fuel gas using wet scrubbing technologies, dry regenerable sorbents, membranes, cryogenics, pressure and temperature swing adsorption, and other advanced concepts. Existing commercial CO2 capture facilities at electric power-generating stations based on the use of monoethanolamine are described, as is the Rectisol process used by Dakota Gasification to separate and capture CO2 from, a coal gasifier.Two technologies for storage of the captured CO2 are reviewed-sequestration in deep unmineable coalbeds with concomitant recovery of CH4 and sequestration in deep saline aquifers. Key issues for both of these techniques include estimating the potential storage capacity, the storage integrity, and the physical and chemical processes that are initiated by injecting CO2 underground. Recent studies using computer modeling as well as laboratory and field experimentation are presented here. In addition, several projects have been initiated in which CO2 is injected into a deep coal seam or saline aquifer. The current status of several such projects is discussed. Included is a commercial-scale project in which a million tons of CO2 are injected annually into an aquifer under the North Sea in Norway. The review makes the case that this can all be accomplished safely with off-the-shelf technologies. However, substantial research and development must be performed to reduce the cost, decrease the risks, and increase the safety of sequestration technologies.This review also includes discussion of possible problems related to deep injection of CO2. There are safety concerns that need to be addressed because of the possibilities of leakage to the surface and induced seismic activity. These issues are presented along with a case study of a similar incident in the past. It is clear that monitoring and verification of storage will be a crucial part of all geological sequestration practices so that such Problems may be avoided. Available techniques include direct measurement of CO2 and CH4 surface soil fluxes, the use of chemical tracers, and underground 4-D seismic monitoring.Ten new hypotheses were formulated to describe what happens when CO2 is pumped into a coal seam. These hypotheses provide significant insight into the fundamental chemical, physical, and thermodynamic phenomena that occur during coal seam sequestration of CO2.;2003;0;0;
Extraction of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through engineered chemical sinkage;Results of economics and scaling measurements, atmospheric simulations, and laboratory experiments made a strong case to explore CO2 extraction from air as an advanced CO2 capture and sequestration technology. The process compared very favorably against renewable sources, e.g., solar, wind, or biomass. This scheme is attractive because it allows CO2 sequestration without a costly change in the existing infrastructure. It collects the CO2 from the transportation and other distributed power sources. It also retains carbon-based energy, which continues to be highly cost-effective, and it has the potential of restoring atmospheric CO2 to pre-industrial levels providing insurance against any large and rapid climate change events in the future.;2002;1;1;
Science & technology concentrates: Method would extract CO2 directly from air;"CO2 released from combustion of small or mobile sources can perhaps be captured and sequestered by ""scrubbing"" the entire atmosphere. Manvendra K. Dubey, chemical physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, and his colleagues are exploring the feasibility of such an approach, which has the potential to allow continued use of fossil fuels without adding to CO2 levels in the atmosphere. A simple aqueous solution of Ca(OH)2 efficiently removes most of the CO2 from air bubbled through it. If carried out on a large scale, the atmosphere would become a free transportation network to bring the gas to the scrubbers, which could be located at sites conducive for sequestration.";2002;1;0;
CO2 capture and removal system for a gas-steam combined cycle;This paper presents the study of a natural gas fired power cycle which includes a carbon dioxide capture plant based on an absorption and scrubbing system. The interest in this integration is due to the widespread use of combined cycles in the power generation sector because of their high energy conversion efficiency. Energy consumption of the capture and removal system and its influence on the energetic performance of the power plant have been calculated. Mass and heat balance calculations are carried out by using the software tools GateCycle for the combined cycle and Aspen+ Software for the absorption process. Results of plant performance calculations, including compression of the captured carbon dioxide, are presented. The results, compared to the combined cycle power plant with no carbon dioxide capture, have also been compared to the more commonly known carbon dioxide capture process based on atmospheric absorption with MEA.

Bimodal breathing in the estuarine crab Chasmagnathus granulatus Dana1851 - physiological and morphological studies;Chasmagnathus granulatus is an estuarine crab which actively moves from subtidal to supratidal areas. To elucidate the possible existence of extrabranchial sites for aerial gas exchange, we measured respiratory and acid-base variables in animals with and without branchial water (controls and experimental crabs. respectively) during air exposure. An histological study of the branchiostegite was also performed. Throughout 4 h of emergence C. granulatus did not suffer venous hypoxia, even without branchial water. The rate of oxygen uptake (M-O2) was similar in both groups. The rate of carbon dioxide excretion (M-CO2) and the gas exchange ratio (R) significantly decreased during emergence in both groups, with R significantly lower for experimental crabs. Consequently, CO2 was accumulated in the hemolymph. This variable stabilized after 90 min in control animals. but experimental crabs continued accumulating CO2. Histological study of the branchiostegites demonstrated the presence of an attenuated and greatly perfused epithelium facing the branchial chamber lumen, with a shortest diffusion distance of 0.5 mu m. Simple folds and lobulated projections increase the respiratory surface area. These results suggest that C. granulatus is a bimodal breathing crab, active both in water and air. When emerged, this species extract oxygen directly from air through branchiostegal lungs, but relies on branchial exchange to eliminate carbon dioxide. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

Influence of storage time and temperature of air-dried soils on pH andextractable nutrients using 0.01 mol/L CaCl2;The stability of pH and certified amounts of nitrate, ammonia, total soluble nitrogen, total soluble organic carbon, magnesium, sodium, potassium and phosphorus obtained by extraction from air-dried (40 degrees C) soil samples by 0.01 mol/L CaCl2 solution during storage at -18 degrees C, 4 degrees C, ambient temperature, 40 degrees C and 70 degrees C was investigated in one calcareous soil and one acid sandy soil. Even at storage times of 45 and 90 days, extractable amounts changed. Extractable amounts of P, NH4-N, total soluble N and soluble organic C increased even at a storage temperature of 40 degrees C. The pH was lower for samples stored at a temperature of 70 degrees C and also the Mg concentration became lower at elevated storage temperatures after 45 days in both soils. It is suggested that reference materials certified for values using unbuffered extractants should be stored at a temperature not higher than 4 degrees C.;1998;0;0;
Solar voltaic generation power plants 1000 MW to 10 kW photovoltaic plant design and application guide for the pacific northwest;Solar Voltaic Generation is shown in a generic power plant design for utility distribution engineering, construction and operation in plant capacities from several kilowatt consumer loads to gigawatt central-stations. Weather-based solar-fuel availability predictions and confirming measurements for regional locations show the expected dispatchable power from a 1000 MW-gmc SVG Power Plant. Solar-fuel to electricity conversion at the plant is supplied by any 2m2, 200 watt or higher capacity solar photovoltaic unit generator module. The modules are plugged into the utility's plant structure and power-electronics, selling energy through standardized power-scada interface connectors. Kilowatt production collocated with crops on the same tilled land mitigates impacts of large array areas and can capture atmospheric CO2. Diurnal and seasonal variations in solar voltaic generation are shown integrated into the region's hydroelectric capacity. A near-term, 100-year life, SVG Plant, less the pv-modules, is estimated at $160/kW. Solar power cost-effectiveness hinges on the pv-module industry soon attaining mass-production factory-costs to sell power at a plug-in interface, in 20% fuel-dependent annual capacity factor locations for 20 mills/kWh.;1995;0;0;
APPLICABILITY OF A NOVEL CARBON SORBENT FOR THE PRECONCENTRATION OFVOLATILE CHLORINATED HYDROCARBONS;"Porous carbon sorbent prepared by pyrolysis of saccharose in the presence of silica gel was tested for the preconcentration of chlorinated derivatives of methane, ethane, ethylene and propane in air, particularly in emissions. The trapped components were desorbed by a liquid (carbon disulphide and n-pentane) and measured by high resolution capillary gas chromatography with on-column, splitless injection and name ionization (FID) and electron capture (ECD) detection. The linearity range of the used detector was studied in the concentration range 10 pg-20 ng mu l(-1) for ECD and 1-100 ng mu l(-1) for mo as well as the limits of determination in absolute amounts (for studied components and FID from 103 to 454 pg; for ECD 0.05-127.2 pg) and in concentrations (for FID 3.4-15.1 mu g m(-3); for ECD 1.5-4240.0 ng m(-3)).";1995;0;0;
DEVELOPMENT OF A SUPERCRITICAL-FLUID EXTRACTION PROCEDURE FORTRIBUTYLTIN DETERMINATION IN SEDIMENTS;The effect of extraction variables, such as extraction time, temperature and extraction agent composition (X), in supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) of tributyltin (TBT) from a spiked sediment, has been optimized by using a factorial-fractional experimental design. Under the optimum conditions (T = 60 degrees C, P = 35 MPa, X = 5.1 M methanol in CO2, t = 30 min) the TBT extraction efficiency was 82% with a coefficient of variation (C.V.) of 9.2% (n = 5). Furthermore, the analytical procedure was validated using a reference material (RM) certified for its TBT content and was successfully applied to the analysis of a Certified Reference Material (CRM). Furthermore, an intercomparison of the SFE with another extraction procedure based on atmospheric pressure liquid extraction (APE) for the TBT determination in sediments has been carried out. Although TBT recoveries were significantly higher in the SFE procedure, the precision of both methods was comparable, probably associated to the similar steps in the extract treatment procedure (derivatization and clean up).;1994;0;0;
USE OF ADSORBENTS TO COLLECT SELECTED HALOCARBONS AND HYDROHALOCARBONSOF ENVIRONMENTAL INTEREST FROM LARGE AIR VOLUMES;"Hydrohalocarbons are the proposed replacement compounds for the chlorofluorocarbons. They will initially have very low concentrations, on the order of a ppt (v/v), in the global atmosphere. Neither gas chromatography-electron-capture detection, nor gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, have adequate sensitivity to measure such concentrations directly from air samples; concentration techniques are required to achieve this. We have examined a range of commercially-available adsorbents, including activated charcoals, carbon molecular sieves, porous polymers, and graphitized carbons, for their suitability as ambient temperature concentrating traps for a range of man-made halocarbons and hydrohalocarbons (CFC-12, CFC-11, CFC-13, HCFC-22, HCFC-123 and HFC-134a). From our measurements of specific retention and desorption volumes it was found that no one adsorbent could both collect all of the target compounds with high efficiency, and also allow efficient recovery by thermal desorption. A sequence of adsorbents is required. We designed a 30 cm long x 0.64 cm O.D. trap containing HayeSep D(B) (a porous polymer), Carboxen 1000 and Carbosieve S-II (both carbon molecular sieves) to collect all of the target compounds from a 5 1 air sample at 25-degrees-C and allow efficient recovery with 500 ml of nitrogen carrier gas at 200-degrees-C. Good comparability was demonstrated between the adsorbent trapping system and direct loop injection analysis for CFC-12 in ambient air. Precision for all of the compounds analyzed with the adsorbent trap was better than 4%, and improved to better than 1% when ratioed to CFC-12.";1993;0;0;
Evaluation of OSHA method 5 for measuring chloroform in pulp and paper industry workplace and ambient atmospheres;"As a result of the recent lowering of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA's) permissible exposure limit (PEL) for chloroform from 50 ppm to 2 ppm, interest has increased in measuring chloroform in pulp and paper industry workplace atmospheres. OSHA suggested that its Method 5 should be used for measuring chloroform concentrations in the range of the new PEL. There are some potential problems with using Method 5 for this purpose. Pulp and paper industry atmospheres may interfere with the measurement because of high temperature, high humidity, and the presence of chlorine. The charcoal sorbent tubes specified in OSHA Method 5 were challenged in the laboratory with a test gas containing 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2 times the PEL of chloroform at 38°C with 80% to 93% relative humidity and ca. 0.5 ppm chlorine. Application of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) validation protocol to the results indicated a bias of -8.2% and a pooled coefficient of variation (C̄V̄) of 0.0274. The method C̄V̄ is less than the critical C̄V̄; thus, the method is acceptable by the NIOSH validation protocol under these conditions. Field testing of OSHA Method 5 was successful and did not reveal any unexpected problems. Additional tests showed that with some modification, OSHA Method 5 can be used to measure chloroform concentrations in ambient atmospheres down to 0.1 ppb.";1992;0;0;
Automated trace analysis of airborne C1- and C2-halocarbons;"Representative concentrations of volatile halocarbons in ambient air are determined by automated, repetitive sampling with sorbent-packed traps, followed by on-line thermodesorption, stationary-phase focussing, capillary gas chromatography, and electron-capture detection. Cryogenic enrichment and the associated problem of water-collection are avoided by ambient trapping using micro-traps packed with organic polymer- and carbon molecular-sieve sorbents. Under optimization of flow conditions and by use of thick-film capillaries, components with boiling points even below ambient temperature can be analyzed on-line by capillary gas chromatography, without the need for cryogenic peak focussing during injection. Data storage, quantification, statistical evaluation, and graphics generation are performed with commercial software programs. The instrumentation can be adapted for monitoring chemically stable volatile trace components with low and medium polarity. The results obtained with the instrumentation show that atmospheric levels of the major C1/C2-halocarbons may fluctuate over short time intervals; therefore, several hundred values must be accumulated for comparison of air pollutant burdens at different locations. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.";1991;0;0;
Ventilation and oxygen extraction in the little penguin (Eudyptula minor), at different temperatures in air and water;Oxygen consumption, (V̇O2), carbon dioxide production (V̇CO2) and ventilation were measured in little penguins (Eudyptula minor) in air and water over a range of ambient temperatures. Barometrically measured minimum ventilation was very low (112 ± 23 ml·min-1 over the range 15-20°C, n=9), principally due to a lower than predicted respiratory frequency (f) (6.9±1.1 min-1). This low ventilation resulted in a very high oxygen extraction (EO2) and low air convection requirement (V̇i/V̇O2). Despite large increases in metabolic rate in birds in cold water, V̇i/V̇O2 and hence EO2 did not vary in non-heat exposed penguins over a range of air and water temperatures. Mean extraction was 53.2±10.8% (n=82) corresponding to an air convection requirement of 1.13±2.5L·L-1. Above thermoneutrality there was a dramatic increase in ventilation and fall in EO2 resulting from increases in both f and tidal volume (Vt). Eng-expired gases were measuerd at thermoneutrality and during heat exposure. At thermoneutrality FeCO2′ was 0.074±0.005, and FeO2′ 0.115±0.009. During heat exposure end expired gases approached atmospheric levels. © 1988.;1988;0;0;
Production of synthetic methanol from air and water using controlled thermonuclear reactor power-I. technology and energy requirement;Methanol synthesis from carbon dioxide, water and nuclear fusion energy is extensively investigated. The entire system is analyzed from the point of view of process design of various processes. The main potential advantage of a fusion reactor (CTR) for this purpose is that it provides a large source of low cost, environmentally acceptable electric power based on an abundant fuel source. Carbon dioxide is obtained by extraction from the atmosphere or from sea water. Hydrogen is obtained by electrolysis of water. Methanol is synthesized by the catalytic reaction of carbon dioxide and hydrogen. The water electrolysis and methanol synthesis units are considered to be technically and commercially available. The benefit of using air or sea water as a source of carbon dioxide is to provide an essentially unlimited renewable and environmentally acceptable source of hydrocarbon fuel. Extraction of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere also allows a high degree of freedom in plant siting. The significant contribution of the present study is the evaluation of various methods of separation of carbon dioxide from air or sea water. Eight different methods of extraction of carbon dioxide from air are analyzed: (1) absorption and stripping of air by water at atmospheric pressure, (2) absorption and stripping of air by water at atmospheric pressure with a cooling tower as part of the absorption unit, (3) absorption and stripping of air by water at higher pressure, 20 atm, (4) absorption and stripping of air by methanol at 20 atm and -80°F, (5) removal of water vapor by adsorption on molecular sieves and subsequent extraction of carbon dioxide by refrigeration, (6) removal of water vapor by compression refrigeration and subsequent extraction of carbon dioxide by refrigeration, (7) absorption and stripping of air by a dilute aqueous potassium carbonate solution, and (8) removal of water vapor by adsorption on molecular sieves and adsorption/desorption of carbon dioxide from dry air by molecular sieves. A method of stripping of carbon dioxide from sea water is also presented. In order to compare these newly developed methods for CO2 separation with other conventional non-fossil sources of carbon, the calcination of limestone is also examined. For the extraction of carbon dioxide from air, the process of absorption/stripping of air by dilute potassium carbonate solution is found to require the least amount of energy. The total energy required for methanol synthesis from these sources of carbon dioxide is 3.90 kWh(e)/1b methanol of which 90% is used for generation of hydrogen. The process which consumes the greatest amount of energy is the absorption/stripping of air by water at high pressure and amounts to 13.2 kWh(e)/1b methanol. A subsequent paper will consider the important topic of economic evaluation. © 1977.;1977;1;0;
