## Enhanced Weathering / Ocean Fertilisation / Ocean Alkalanisation
- Units are in original. **Conversions applied**
- The potentials are not tied to years. *Can we simply take all estimates as maximum potentials for annual flux over the next century?*
- System conditions. *Should we filter for any particular subcategory? Or do multiple bars for several categories?*
- System boundaries. *What do we do with lab scale?*

## Soil Carbon Sequestration
- Years are often missing, ranges or descriptions - *can we take take all estimates 
as maximum potentials for annual flux over the next century?*

- Global has several different values, like "Global estimates based on literature review" or "Global - "agroforestry system".
 *Do we just count all of them as "global" during filter?*

- Subcategories. *Most estimates are totals, but should we filter / show sub-bars, for subcategories (e.g. pasture land only)?"*

## BECCS
- Subcategories. *How do we deal with subcategories (in comparison figure)?*
